[.lead]
PostgreSQL databases can be hosted on NFSv3 or NFSv4 filesystems. The best option depends on factors outside the database. 

For example, NFSv4 locking behavior may be preferable in certain clustered environments. (See link:../oracle/oracle-notes-stale-nfs-locks.html[here] for additional details)

Database functionality should otherwise be close to identical, including performance. The only requirement is the use of the `hard` mount option. This is required to ensure soft timeouts do not produce unrecoverable IO errors.

If NFSv4 is chosen as a protocol, NetApp recommends using NFSv4.1. There are some functional enhancements to the NFSv4 protocol in NFSv4.1 that improve resiliency over NFSv4.0.


Use the following mount options for general database workloads:
....
rw,hard,nointr,bg,vers=[3|4],proto=tcp,rsize=65536,wsize=65536
....

If heavy sequential IO is expected, the NFS transfer sizes can be increased as described in the following section.

== NFS Transfer Sizes

include::../_include/nfs-transfer-sizes.adoc[]

Once the transfer size is increased at the ONTAP level, the following mount options would be used:

....
rw,hard,nointr,bg,vers=[3|4],proto=tcp,rsize=262144,wsize=262144
....

== NFSv3 TCP Slot Tables

If NFSv3 is used with Linux, it is critical to properly set the TCP slot tables.
