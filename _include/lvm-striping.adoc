Before the era of flash drives, striping was used to help overcome the performance limitations of spinning drives. For example, if an OS needs to perform a 1MB read operation, reading that 1MB of data from a single drive would require a lot of drive head seeking and reading as the 1MB is slowly transferred. If that 1MB of data was striped across 8 LUNs, the OS could issue eight 128K read operations in parallel and reduce the time required to complete the 1MB transfer.

Striping with spinning drives was more difficult because the I/O pattern had to be known in advance. If the striping wasn't correctly tuned for the true I/O patterns, striped configurations could damage performance. With Oracle databases, and especially with all-flash configurations, striping is much easier to configure and has been proven to dramatically improve performance.

Logical volume managers such as Oracle ASM stripe by default, but native OS LVM do not. Some of them bond multiple LUNs together as a concatenated device, which results in datafiles that exist on one and only one LUN device. This causes hot spots. Other LVM implementations default to distributed extents. This is similar to striping, but it's coarser. The LUNs in the volume group are sliced into large pieces, called extents and typically measured in many megabytes, and the logical volumes are then distributed across those extents. The result is random I/O against a file should be well distributed across LUNs, but sequential I/O operations are not as efficient as they could be.

Performance-intensive application I/O is nearly always either (a) in units of the basic block size or (b) one megabyte.

The primary goal of a striped configuration is to ensure that single-file I/O can be performed as a single unit, and multiblock I/Os, which should be 1MB in size, can be parallelized evenly across all LUNs in the striped volume. This means that the stripe size must not be smaller than the database block size, and the stripe size multiplied by the number of LUNs should be 1MB.

The following figure shows three possible options for stripe size and width tuning. The number of LUNs is selected to meet performance requirements as described above, but in all cases the total data within a single stripe is 1MB.
