Oracle databases can use NFS in two ways.

First, it can use a filesystem mounted using the native NFS client that is part of the operating system. This is sometimes called kernel NFS, or kNFS. The NFS filesystem is mounted and used by the Oracle database exactly the same as any other application would use an NFS filesystem.

The second method is Oracle Direct NFS (dNFS). This is an implementation of the NFS standard within the Oracle database software. It does not change the way Oracle databases are configured or managed by the DBA. As long as the storage system itself has the correct settings, the use of dNFS should be transparent to the DBA team and end users.

A database with the dNFS feature enabled still has the usual NFS filesystems mounted. Once the database is open, the Oracle database opens a set of TCP/IP sessions and performs NFS operations directly.

== Direct NFS
The primary value of Oracle's Direct NFS is to bypass the host NFS client and perform NFS file operations directly on an NFS server. Enabling it only requires changing the Oracle Disk Manager (ODM) library. Instructions for this process are provided in the Oracle documentation.

Using dNFS results in a significant improvement in I/O performance and decreases the load on the host and the storage system because I/O is performed in the most efficient way possible.

In addition, Oracle dNFS includes an *option* for network interface multipathing and fault-tolerance. For example, two 10Gb interfaces can be bound together to offer 20Gb of bandwidth. A failure of one interface results in I/O being retried on the other interface. The overall operation is very similar to FC multipathing. Multipathing was common years ago when 1Gb ethernet was the most common standard. A 10Gb NIC is sufficient for most Oracle workloads, but if more is required 10Gb NICs can be bonded.

When dNFS is used, it is critical that all patches described in Oracle Doc 1495104.1 are installed. If a patch cannot be installed, the environment must be evaluated to make sure that the bugs described in that document do not cause problems. In some cases, an inability to install the required patches prevents the use of dNFS.

[Note]
Do not use dNFS with any type of round-robin name resolution, including DNS, DDNS, NIS or any other method. This includes the DNS load balancing feature available in ONTAP. When an Oracle database using dNFS resolves a host name to an IP address it must not change on subsequent lookups. This can result in Oracle database crashes and possible data corruption.

=== Direct NFS and host file system access
Using dNFS can occasionally cause problems for applications or user activities that rely on the visible file systems mounted on the host because the dNFS client accesses the file system out of band from the host OS. The dNFS client can create, delete, and modify files without the knowledge of the OS.

When the mount options for single-instance databases are used, they enable caching of file and directory attributes, which also means that the contents of a directory are cached. Therefore, dNFS can create a file, and there is a short lag before the OS rereads the directory contents and the file becomes visible to the user. This is not generally a problem, but, on rare occasions, utilities such as SAP BR*Tools might have issues. If this happens, address the problem by changing the mount options to use the recommendations for Oracle RAC. This change results in the disabling of all host caching.

Only change mount options when (a) dNFS is used and (b) a problem results from a lag in file visibility. If dNFS is not in use, using Oracle RAC mount options on a single-instance database results in degraded performance.

[NOTE]
See the note about `nosharecache` in link:oracle-host-config-linux.html#linux-direct-nfs[Linux NFS mount options] for a Linux-specific dNFS issue that can produce unusual results.
