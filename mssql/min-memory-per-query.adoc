= Min memory per query

[.lead]
When a query is run, SQL Server tries to allocate the optimum amount of memory for it to run efficiently.

By default, the min memory per query setting allocates > or = to 1024KB for each query to run. It is a best practice is to leave this setting at the default value of 0 to allow SQL Server to dynamically manage the amount of memory allocated for index creation operations. However, if SQL Server has more RAM than it needs to run efficiently, the performance of some queries can be boosted if you increase this setting. Therefore, as long as memory is available on the server that is not being used by SQL Server, any other applications, or the operating system, then boosting this setting can help overall SQL Server performance. If no free memory is available, increasing this setting might hurt overall performance.
