SM-as and MetroCluster are similar in overall functionality, but there are important differences in the way in which RPO=0 replication was implemented and how it is managed. SnapMirror asynchronous and synchronous can also be used as part of a DR plan, but they are not designed as HA repliation technologies.

* A MetroCluster configuration is more like one integrated cluster with nodes distributed across sites. SM-as behaves like two otherwise independent clusters that are cooperating in serving up select RPO=0 synchronously replicated LUNs.
* The data in a MetroCluster configuration is only accessible from one particular site at any given time. A second copy of the data is present on the opposite site, but the data is passive. It cannot be accessed without a storage system failover.
* MetroCluster and SM-as perform mirroring occurs at different levels. MetroCluster mirroring is performed at the RAID layer. The low-level data is stored in a mirrored format using SyncMirror. The use of mirroring is virtually invisible up at the LUN, volume, and protocol layers.
* In contrast, SM-as mirroring occurs at the protocol layer. The two clusters are overall independent clusters. Once the two copies of data are in sync, the two clusters only need to mirror writes. When a write occurs on one cluster, it is replicated to the other cluster. The write is only acknowledged to the host when the write has completed on both sites. Other than this protocol splitting behavior, the two clusters are otherwise normal ONTAP clusters.
* The primary role for MetroCluster is large-scale replication. You can replicate an entire array with RPO=0 and near-zero RTO. This simplifies the failover process because there is only one "thing" to fail over, and it scales extremely well in terms of capacity and IOPS.
* One key use case for SM-as is granular replication. Sometimes you donâ€™t want to replicate all data as a single unit, or you need to be able to selectively fail over certain workloads.
* Another key use case for SM-as is for active-active operations, where you want fully usable copies of data to be available on two different clusters located in two different locations with identical performance characteristics and, if desired, no requirement to stretch the SAN across sites. You can have your applications already running on both sites, which reduces the overall RTO during failover operations.
