summary: A storage connector is required only in multiple-host environments that have failover capabilities. In multiple-host setups, SAP HANA provides high-availability functionality so that an SAP HANA database host can fail over to a standby host. In this case, the LUNs of the failed host are accessed and used by the standby host.

A storage connector is required only in multiple-host environments that have failover capabilities. In multiple-host setups, SAP HANA provides high-availability functionality so that an SAP HANA database host can fail over to a standby host. In this case, the LUNs of the failed host are accessed and used by the standby host. The storage connector is used to make sure that a storage partition can be actively accessed by only one database host at a time.

In SAP HANA multiple-host configurations with NetApp storage, the standard storage connector delivered by SAP is used. The “SAP HANA Fibre Channel Storage Connector Admin Guide” can be found as an attachment to https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1900823[SAP note 1900823^].
