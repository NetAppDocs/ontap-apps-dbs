The term "failover" does not refer to the direction of replication with SnapMirror active sync because it is a bidirectional replication technology. Instead, 'failover' refers to which storage system will be the preferred site in the event of failure. 

For example, you may want to perform a failover to change the preferred site before you shut down a site for maintenance, or before performing a DR test.

Changing the preferred site requires a simple operation. IO will pause for a second or two as authority over replication behavior switches between clusters, but IO is otherwise unaffected. 

GUI example:

Example of changing it back via the CLI:

....
Cluster2::> snapmirror failover start -destination-path jfs_as2:/cg/jfsAA
[Job 9575] Job is queued: SnapMirror failover for destination "jfs_as2:/cg/jfsAA                      ".

Cluster2::> snapmirror failover show

The new destination path can be verified as follows:


Cluster1::> snapmirror show -destination-path jfs_as1:/cg/jfsAA
