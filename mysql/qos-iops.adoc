= IOPS QoS

An IOPS QoS control is based on the total IOPS of a given resource, but there are several aspects of IOPS QoS that might not be intuitive. Some customers have been puzzled by the apparent increase in latency when an IOPS threshold is reached. This IOPS QoS is the only viable method of limiting IOPS. Logically, it functions like a token system. For example, if a volume containing data files has a 10K IOPS limit, each I/O operation that arrives must first receive a token to continue processing. As long as no more than 10K tokens are consumed in a second, no delays are present.
