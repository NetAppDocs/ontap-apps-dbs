= LUN Misalignment Warnings

Database logging normally generates unaligned I/O that can cause misleading warnings about misaligned LUNs on ONTAP. The reason is that most databases perform a sequential write of the log file with writes of varying size. A log write operation that does not align to 4KB boundaries does not ordinarily cause performance problems, because the next log write operation completes the block. The result is that ONTAP is able to process almost all writes as complete 4KB blocks, even though the data in some 4KB blocks was written in two separate operations.
