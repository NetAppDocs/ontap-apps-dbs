Database redo/transaction logging normally generates unaligned I/O that can cause misleading warnings about misaligned LUNs on ONTAP. 

Logging performs a sequential write of the log file with writes of varying size. A log write operation that does not align to 4KB boundaries does not ordinarily cause performance problems because the next log write operation completes the block. The result is that ONTAP is able to process almost all writes as complete 4KB blocks, even though the data in some 4KB blocks was written in two separate operations.

Verify alignment by using by using utilities such as `sio` or `dd` that can generate I/O at a defined block size. The I/O alignment statistics on the storage system can be viewed with the `stats` command. See link:../notes/wafl_alignment_verification.html[WAFL alignment verification] for more information.
