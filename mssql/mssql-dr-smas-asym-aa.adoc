[.lead]
SQL Server on SnapMirror active sync provides transparent failover during the planned and unplanned storage events. In this configuration, primary storage managed read/write operations and secondary is read-only.

SnapMirror active sync asymmetric active/active (formerly SnapMirror Business Continuity SM-BC) is enabled by using protection policy AutomatedFailoverOver while creating business continuity relationship.In this setup only one storage does the read/write operation, write operations coming to mirror storage are proxied to primary storage resulting in multiple network round trips.

This policy can be ideal for regulatory complaince or centralized backup and business continuity for remote offices.Secondary storage can be used as testing environment creating clone copy of volume. 

== Path access

In this configuration of SnapMirror active sync, storage devices are visible to host operating systems from both the primary and remote storage arrays. Paths are managed through asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA), which is an industry standard protocol for identifying optimized paths between a storage system and a host. The device path that is the shortest to access I/O is considered Active/Optimized paths and the rest of the paths are considered Active/Nonoptimized paths.

The SnapMirror active sync relationship is between a pair of SVMs located on different clusters. Both SVMs are capable of serving data, but ALUA will preferentially use the SVM that currently has ownership of the drives on which the LUNs reside. IO to the remote SVM will be proxied across the with SnapMirror active sync interconnect.
