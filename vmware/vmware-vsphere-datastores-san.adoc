NetApp ONTAP provides enterprise-class block storage for VMware vSphere using iSCSI, Fibre Channel Protocol(FCP, or FC for short), and NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF). The following are best practices for implementing block protocols for VM storage with vSphere and ONTAP.

In vSphere, there are three ways to use block storage LUNs:

* With VMFS datastores
* With raw device mapping (RDM)
* As a LUN accessed and controlled by a software initiator from a VM guest OS

VMFS is a high-performance clustered file system that provides datastores that are shared storage pools. VMFS datastores can be configured with LUNs accessed using FC, iSCSI, FCoE, or with NVMe namespaces accessed using the NVMe/FC or NVMe/TCP protocols. VMFS allows storage to be accessed simultaneously by every ESX server in a cluster. The maximum LUN size is generally 128TB beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1P2 (and earlier with ASA systems); therefore, a maximum-size VMFS 5 or 6 datastore of 64TB can be created by using a single LUN.

vSphere includes built-in support for multiple paths to storage devices, referred to as native multipathing (NMP). NMP can detect the type of storage for supported storage systems and automatically configures the NMP stack to support the capabilities of the storage system in use.

Both NMP and ONTAP support Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) to negotiate optimized and nonoptimized paths. In ONTAP, an ALUA-optimized path follows a direct data path, using a target port on the node that hosts the LUN being accessed. ALUA is turned on by default in both vSphere and ONTAP. The NMP recognizes the ONTAP cluster as ALUA, and it uses the ALUA storage array type plug-in (`VMW_SATP_ALUA`) and selects the round robin path selection plug-in (`VMW_PSP_RR`).

ESXi 6 supports up to 256 LUNs and up to 1,024 total paths to LUNs. ESXi does not see any LUNs or paths beyond these limits. Assuming the maximum number of LUNs, the path limit allows four paths per LUN. In a larger ONTAP cluster, it is possible to reach the path limit before the LUN limit. To address this limitation, ONTAP supports selective LUN map (SLM) in release 8.3 and later.

SLM limits the nodes that advertise paths to a given LUN. It is a NetApp best practice to have at least one LIF per node per SVM and to use SLM to limit the paths advertised to the node hosting the LUN and its HA partner. Although other paths exist, they aren't advertised by default. It is possible to modify the paths advertised with the add and remove reporting node arguments within SLM. Note that LUNs created in releases prior to 8.3 advertise all paths and need to be modified to only advertise the paths to the hosting HA pair. For more information about SLM, review section 5.9 of http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4080.pdf[TR-4080^]. The previous method of portsets can also be used to further reduce the available paths for a LUN. Portsets help by reducing the number of visible paths through which initiators in an igroup can see LUNs.

* SLM is enabled by default. Unless you are using portsets, no additional configuration is required.

* For LUNs created prior to Data ONTAP 8.3, manually apply SLM by running the `lun mapping remove-reporting-nodes` command to remove the LUN reporting nodes and restrict LUN access to the LUN-owning node and its HA partner.

Block protocols (iSCSI, FC, and FCoE) access LUNs by using LUN IDs and serial numbers, along with unique names. FC and FCoE use worldwide names (WWNNs and WWPNs), and iSCSI uses iSCSI qualified names (IQNs). The path to LUNs inside the storage is meaningless to the block protocols and is not presented anywhere in the protocol. Therefore, a volume that contains only LUNs does not need to be internally mounted at all, and a junction path is not needed for volumes that contain LUNs used in datastores. The NVMe subsystem in ONTAP works similarly.

Other best practices to consider:

* Make sure that a logical interface (LIF) is created for each SVM on each node in the ONTAP cluster for maximum availability and mobility. ONTAP SAN best practice is to use two physical ports and LIFs per node, one for each fabric. ALUA is used to parse paths and identify active optimized (direct) paths versus active nonoptimized paths. ALUA is used for FC, FCoE, and iSCSI.
* For iSCSI networks, use multiple VMkernel network interfaces on different network subnets with NIC teaming when multiple virtual switches are present. You can also use multiple physical NICs connected to multiple physical switches to provide HA and increased throughput. The following figure provides an example of multipath connectivity. In ONTAP, configure either a single-mode interface group for failover with two or more links that are connected to two or more switches, or use LACP or other link-aggregation technology with multimode interface groups to provide HA and the benefits of link aggregation.
* If the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used in ESXi for target authentication, it must also be configured in ONTAP using the CLI (`vserver iscsi security create`) or with System Manager (edit Initiator Security under Storage > SVMs > SVM Settings > Protocols > iSCSI).
* Use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to create and manage LUNs and igroups. The plug-in automatically determines the WWPNs of servers and creates appropriate igroups. It also configures LUNs according to best practices and maps them to the correct igroups.
* Use RDMs with care because they can be more difficult to manage,  and they also use paths, which are limited as described earlier. ONTAP LUNs support both https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2009226[physical and virtual compatibility mode^] RDMs.
