Out of sync network time config can sometime cause security issues.

== *vApp*

You can configure NTP server from maintenance_console in vApp.  User can add the NTP server details under _System Configuration_ => _Add new NTP Server_ option

By default the service for NTP is ntpd on vApp. This is a legacy service and does not work well for virtual machines in certain cases.

== *Debian* 

On Debian user can access the /etc/ntp.conf file for ntp server details.
