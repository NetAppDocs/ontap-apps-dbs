Some disruption during a foreign LUN import is unavoidable because of the need to change the FC network configuration. However, the disruption does not have to last much longer than the time required to restart the database environment and update FC zoning to switch the host FC connectivity from the foreign LUN to ONTAP.

This process can be summarized as follows:

. Quiesce all LUN activity on the foreign LUNs.
. Redirect host FC connections to the new ONTAP system.
. Trigger the import process.
. Rediscover the LUNs.
. Restart the database.

You do not need to wait for the migration process to complete. As soon as the migration for a given LUN begins, it is available on ONTAP and can serve data while the data copy process continues. All reads are passed through to the foreign LUN, and all writes are synchronously written to both arrays. The copy operation is very fast and the overhead of redirecting FC traffic is minimal, so any impact on performance should be transient and minimal. If there is concern, you can delay restarting the environment until after the migration process is complete and the import relationships have been deleted.

== Shut down database
The first step in quiescing the environment in this example is to shut down the database.

== Shut down grid services
One of the SAN-based file systems being migrated also includes the Oracle ASM services. Quiescing the underlying LUNs requires dismounting the file systems, which in turn means stopping any processes with open files on this file system.

....

....

== Dismount file systems
If all the processes are shut down, the umount operation succeeds. If permission is denied, there must be a process with a lock on the file system. The `fuser` command can help identify these processes.

....
[root@host1 ~]# umount /orabin
[root@host1 ~]# umount /backups
....

== Deactivate volume groups
After all file systems in a given volume group are dismounted, the volume group can be deactivated.

....
[root@host1 ~]# vgchange --activate n sanvg
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "sanvg" now active
[root@host1 ~]#
....

== FC network changes
The FC zones can now be updated to remove all access from the host to the foreign array and establish access to ONTAP.

== Start import process
To start the LUN import processes, run the `lun import start` command.

....
Cluster01::lun import*> lun import start -vserver vserver1 -path /vol/new_asm/LUN0
Cluster01::lun import*> lun import start -vserver vserver1 -path /vol/new_asm/LUN1
...
Cluster01::lun import*> lun import start -vserver vserver1 -path /vol/new_lvm/LUN8
Cluster01::lun import*> lun import start -vserver vserver1 -path /vol/new_lvm/LUN9
Cluster01::lun import*>
....

== Monitor import progress
The import operation can be monitored with the `lun import show` command. As shown below, the import of all 20 LUNs is underway, which means that data is now accessible through ONTAP even though the data copy operation still progresses.

....
Cluster01::lun import*> lun import show -fields path,percent-complete

If you require an offline process, delay rediscovering or restarting services until the `lun import show` command indicates that all migration is successful and complete. You can then complete the migration process as described in link:../migration/migration_options.html#foreign-lun-import-fli[Foreign LUN Importâ€”Completion].

If you require an online migration, proceed to rediscover the LUNs in their new home and bring up the services.

== Scan for SCSI device changes
In most cases, the simplest option to rediscover new LUNs is to restart the host. Doing so automatically removes old stale devices, properly discovers all new LUNs, and builds associated devices such as multipathing devices. The example here shows a wholly online process for demonstration purposes.

Caution: Before restarting a host, make sure that all entries in `/etc/fstab` that reference migrated SAN resources are commented out. If this is not done and there are problems with LUN access, the OS might not boot. This situation does not damage data. However, it can be very inconvenient to boot into rescue mode or a similar mode and correct the `/etc/fstab` so that the OS can be booted to enable troubleshooting.

The LUNs on the version of Linux used in this example can be rescanned with the `rescan-scsi-bus.sh` command. If the command is successful, each LUN path should appear in the output. The output can be difficult to interpret, but, if the zoning and igroup configuration was correct, many LUNs should appear that include a `NETAPP` vendor string.

== Check for multipath devices
The LUN discovery process also triggers the recreation of multipath devices, but the Linux multipathing driver is known to have occasional problems. The output of `multipath - ll` should be checked to verify that the output looks as expected. For example, the output below shows multipath devices associated with a `NETAPP` vendor string. Each device has four paths, with two at a priority of 50 and two at a priority of 10. Although the exact output can vary with different versions of Linux, this output looks as expected.

[NOTE]
Reference the host utilities documentation for the version of Linux you use to verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` settings are correct.

== Reactivate LVM volume group
If the LVM LUNs have been properly discovered, the `vgchange --activate y` command should succeed. This is a good example of the value of a logical volume manager. A change in the WWN of a LUN or even a serial number is unimportant because the volume group metadata is written on the LUN itself.

The OS scanned the LUNs and discovered a small amount of data written on the LUN that identifies it as a physical volume belonging to the `sanvg volumegroup`. It then built all of the required devices. All that is required is to reactivate the volume group.

....
[root@host1 /]# vgchange --activate y sanvg

== Remount file systems
After the volume group is reactivated, the file systems can be mounted with all of the original data intact. As discussed previously, the file systems are fully operational even if data replication is still active in the back group.

== Rescan for ASM devices
The ASMlib devices should have been rediscovered when the SCSI devices were rescanned. Rediscovery can be verified online by restarting ASMlib and then scanning the disks.

[NOTE]
This step is only relevant to ASM configurations where ASMlib is used.

Caution: Where ASMlib is not used, the `/dev/mapper` devices should have been automatically recreated. However, the permissions might not be correct. You must set special permissions on the underlying devices for ASM in the absence of ASMlib. Doing so is usually accomplished through special entries in either the `/etc/multipath.conf` or `udev` rules, or possibly in both rule sets. These files might need to be updated to reflect changes in the environment in terms of WWNs or serial numbers to make sure that the ASM devices still have the correct permissions.

In this example, restarting ASMlib and scanning for disks show the same 10 ASM LUNs as the original environment.

== Restart grid services
Now that the LVM and ASM devices are online and available, the grid services can be restarted.

....
[root@host1 /]# cd /orabin/product/12.1.0/grid/bin
[root@host1 bin]# ./crsctl start has
....

== Restart database
After the grid services have been restarted, the database can be brought up. It might be necessary to wait a few minutes for the ASM services to become fully available before trying to start the database.
