= Guaranteed QoS

Many customers seek a solution that includes guaranteed QoS, which is more difficult than it seems and potentially wasteful. For example, placing 10 databases with a 10K IOPS guarantee would require a system to be sized such that all 10 databases could simultaneously run at 10K IOPS, for a total of 100K. This scenario is highly unlikely, but if it is required, the best option is to guarantee performance through the sizing effort.

For example, each NetApp AFF HA pair could constitute a 400K IOPS building block. The total guaranteed IOPS of all hosted databases should not add up to more than 400K IOPS. Furthermore, to prevent a database from consuming more than its allotted IOPS capability, it should have the standard QoS applied as a limit.
