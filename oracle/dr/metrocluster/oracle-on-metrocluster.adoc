The use of MetroCluster does not necessarily add to or change any best practices for operating a enterprise applications and databases.

The usual best practices still apply, and if your needs only require RPO=0 data protection then that need is met with MetroCluster. However, most customers use MetroCluster not only for RPO=0 data protection, but also to improve RTO during disaster scenarios as well as provide transparent failover as part of site maintenance activities.

== Failover with a preconfigured OS
SyncMirror delivers a synchronous copy of the data at the disaster recovery site, but making that data available requires an operating system and the associated applications. Basic automation can dramatically improve the failover time of the overall environment. Clusterware products such as Oracle RAC, Veritas Cluster Server (VCS) or VMware HA are often used to create a cluster across the sites, and in many cases the failover process can be driven with simple scripts.

If the primary nodes are lost, the clusterware (or scripts) is configured to bring the applications online at the alternate site. One option is to create standby servers that are preconfigured for the NFS or SAN resources that make up the application. If the primary site fails, the clusterware or scripted alternative performs a sequence of actions similar to the following:

. Forcing a MetroCluster switchover
. Performing discovery of FC LUNs (SAN only)
. Mounting file systems
. Starting the application

The primary requirement of this approach is a running OS in place on the remote site. It must be preconfigured with application binaries, which also means that tasks such as patching must be performed on the primary and standby site. Alternatively, the application binaries can be mirrored to the remote site and mounted if a disaster is declared.

The actual activation procedure is simple. Commands such as LUN discovery require just a few commands per FC port. File system mounting is nothing more than a `mount` command, and both databases and ASM can be started and stopped at the CLI with a single command. If the volumes and file systems are not in use at the disaster recovery site prior to the switchover, there is no requirement to set `dr-force- nvfail` on volumes.

== Failover with a virtualized OS
Failover of database environments can be extended to include the operating system itself. In theory, this failover can be done with boot LUNs, but most often it is done with a virtualized OS. The procedure is similar to the following steps:

. Forcing a MetroCluster switchover
. Mounting the datastores hosting the database server virtual machines
. Starting the virtual machines
. Starting databases manually or configuring the virtual machines to automatically start the databases 

For example, an ESX cluster could span sites. In the event of disaster, the virtual machines can be brought online at the disaster recovery site after the switchover. As long as the datastores hosting the virtualized database servers are not in use at the time of the disaster, there is no requirement for setting `dr-force- nvfail` on associated volumes.
