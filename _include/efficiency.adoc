Space efficiency features, such as compression, compaction, and deduplication are designed to increase the amount of logical data that fits on a given amount of physical storage. The result is lower costs and management overhead.

At a high level, compression is a mathematical process whereby patterns in data are detected and encoded in a way that reduces space requirements. In contrast, deduplication detects actual repeated blocks of data and removes the extraneous copies. Compaction allows multiple logical blocks of data to share the same physical block on media.

See the sections below on thin provisioning for an explanation of the interaction between storage efficiency and fractional reservation.
