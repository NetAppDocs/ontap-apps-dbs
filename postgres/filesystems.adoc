[.lead]
PostgreSQL can be hosted on either NFS or SAN filesystems.

== NFS
[TIP]
*NetApp recommends* using NFSv4.1 if NFSv4 capabilities are required. There are some functional enhancements to the NFSv4 protocol in NFSv4.1 that improve resiliency in certain edge cases. 

Use the following mount option while mounting an NFS file system:
....
nfs4 rw, hard,nointr,bg,vers=4,sync,proto=tcp,noatime,rsize=65536,wsize=65536
....

To improve NFS performance, see link:../common/storage-configuration/nfs.html#ontap-nfs-transfer-sizes[NFS transfer sizes].

== SAN
For guidance on SAN configuration and important details about LVM striping and LUN counts, see link:..//common/storage-configuration/fcsan.html[FC SAN].
