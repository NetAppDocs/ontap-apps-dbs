[.lead]
Starting with SAP HANA 2.0 SPS4, additional data volume partitions can be configured. 

This allows you to configure two or more volumes for the data volume of an SAP HANA tenant database and scale beyond the size and performance limits of a single volume.

[NOTE]
Using two or more individual volumes for the data volume is available for SAP HANA single-host and SAP HANA multiple-host systems. You can add additional data volume partitions at any time.

== Enabling additional data volume partitions
To enable additional data volume partitions, add the following entry within `global.ini` by using SAP HANA Studio or Cockpit in the SYSTEMDB configuration.

....
[customizable_functionalities]
persistence_datavolume_partition_multipath = true
....

[NOTE]
Adding the parameter manually to the `global.ini` file requires the restart of the database.

== Volume configuration for single-host SAP HANA systems
The layout of volumes for a single-host SAP HANA system with multiple partitions is like the layout for a system with one data volume partition but with an additional data volume stored on a different aggregate as the log volume and the other data volume. The following table shows an example configuration of an SAP HANA single-host system with two data volume partitions.

|===
|Aggregate 1 at controller A |Aggregate 2 at controller A |Aggregate 1 at controller B |Aggregate 2 at controller b

|Data volume: SID_data_mnt00001
|Shared volume: SID_shared
|Data volume: SID_data2_mnt00001
|Log volume: SID_log_mnt00001

The following table shows an example of the mount point configuration for a single-host system with two data volume partitions.

You can create the new data volume and mount it to the namespace using either NetApp ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

The layout of volumes is like the layout for a multiple- host SAP HANA system with one data volume partition but with an additional data volume stored on a different aggregate as log volume and the other data volume. The following table shows an example configuration of an SAP HANA multiple-host system with two data volume partitions.

You can create the new data volume and mount it to the namespace using either ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

== Host configuration

In addition to the tasks described in the section link:host_setup.html["Host Setup,"] the additional mount points and `fstab` entries for the new additional data volume/s must be created and the new volumes must be mounted.

. Create additional mount points.
+
* For a single-host system, create mount points and set the permissions on the database host:
+
....
sapcc-hana-tst-06:/ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00001
sapcc-hana-tst-06:/ # chmod R 777 /hana/data2/SID
....

* For a multiple-host system, create mount points and set the permissions on all worker and standby hosts.
+
The following example commands are for a 2-plus-1 multiple-host HANA system.
+
** First worker host:
+
....
sapcc-hana-tst-06:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00001
sapcc-hana-tst-06:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00002
sapcc-hana-tst-06:~ # chmod -R 777 /hana/data2/SID
....
+
** Second worker host:
+
....
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00001
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00002
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # chmod -R 777 /hana/data2/SID
....
+
** Standby host:
+
....
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00001
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # mkdir -p /hana/data2/SID/mnt00002
sapcc-hana-tst-07:~ # chmod -R 777 /hana/data2/SID
....
+
. Add the additional file systems to the `/etc/fstab` configuration file on all hosts.
+
See the following example for a single-host system using NFSv4.1:
+
....
<storage-vif-data02>:/SID_data2_mnt00001 /hana/data2/SID/mnt00001 nfs rw, vers=4
minorversion=1,hard,timeo=600,rsize=1048576,wsize=262144,bg,noatime,lock 0 0
....
+

[NOTE]
Use a different storage virtual interface for connecting each data volume to ensure that you are using different TCP sessions for each volume or use the nconnect mount option, if available for your OS.

. Mount the file systems by running the `mount a` command.

== Adding an additional data volume partition

Execute the following SQL statement against the tenant database to add an additional data volume partition to your tenant database. Use the path to additional volumes:

....
ALTER SYSTEM ALTER DATAVOLUME ADD PARTITION PATH '/hana/data2/SID/';
....
