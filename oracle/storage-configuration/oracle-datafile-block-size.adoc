Some OSs offer a choice of file system block sizes. For file systems supporting Oracle datafiles, the block size should be 8KB when compression is used. When compression is not required, a block size of either 8KB or 4KB can be used.

If a datafile is placed on a file system with a 512-byte block, misaligned files are possible. The LUN and the file system might be properly aligned based on NetApp recommendations, but the file I/O would be misaligned. Such a misalignment would cause severe performance problems.
