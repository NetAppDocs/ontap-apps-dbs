[.lead]
The primary value of ONTAP in a database environment comes from the core ONTAP technologies such as instant Snapshot copies, simple SnapMirror replication, and efficient creation of FlexClone volumes. 

In some cases, simple configuration of these features within ONTAP meets requirements, but more complicated needs require an orchestration layer.

== SnapCenter
SnapCenter is the flagship NetApp data protection product. At a very low level, it is similar to the SnapManager products in terms of how it executes database backups, but it was built from the ground up to deliver a single-pane-of-glass for data protection management on NetApp storage systems.

SnapCenter includes the basic functions such as Snapshot based backups and restores, SnapMirror and SnapVault replication, and other features required to operate at scale for large enterprises. These advanced features include an expanded role-based access control (RBAC) capability, RESTful APIs to integrate with third-party orchestration products, nondisruptive central management of SnapCenter plug-ins on database hosts, and a user interface designed for cloud-scale environments.

== REST
ONTAP also contains a rich RESTful API set. This allows 3rd party vendors to create data protection and other management application with deep integration with ONTAP. Furthermore, the RESTful API is easy to consume by customers who wish to create their own automation workflows and utilities.
