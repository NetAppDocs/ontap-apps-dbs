As the default, SAP HANA uses only one data volume per SAP HANA service. Due to the maximum file size limitation of the file system, we recommend limiting the maximum data volume size.

To do so automatically, set the following parameter in `global.ini` in the section `[persistence]`:

....
datavolume_striping = true
datavolume_striping_size_gb = 8000
....

This creates a new data volume after the 8, 000GB limit is reached. https://launchpad.support.sap.com/[SAP note 240005 question 15^] provides more information.
