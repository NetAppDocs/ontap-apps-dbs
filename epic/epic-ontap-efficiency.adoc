== Epic on ONTAP

This section covers a long list of considerations for an Epic solution. I am sure every storage vendor makes the same claims, making the platform decision even more complex. This section helps clarify each of these areas regarding NetApp. When examined all together, ONTAP is the clear choice for any healthcare data management system.

Epic is easier with ONTAP

This consideration is first because it is the most important when selecting a data management platform.

ONTAP is a single data management platform you can consolidate Epic workloads with while meeting all of your requirements.

This is a bold statement, and it is transformative to your organization. Why? Only on NetApp can you standardize all your healthcare workloads for SAN, NAS, and Object on a single high data management platform. ONTAP is the most widely deployed storage software in the world and comes with almost 30 years of constant innovation. You can meet all Epic challenges with native ONTAP data management tools and application integration. There is no need to purchase a multitude of third-party tools to fill gaps in the solution.

A lot of storage vendors offer traditional, reliable, and fast block storage. They work well but are typically deployed in silos to run a single workload like production, report, clarity, VDI, VMWare, and NAS. Each of these silos have different hardware and different management tools, and they are typically managed by different IT groups. This traditional approach adds to the biggest problem with healthcare today.

NetApp makes data management easier and more efficient. Instead of throwing money at the problem with oversized silos, ONTAP uses innovation and technology to enable a consistent and guaranteed SLA for each workload on a single platform over any protocol. These capabilities and tools extend out to the cloud of your choice as illustrated in Figure 3.

= Performance

NetApp is a clear leader in the storage industry as seen in the published performance results in the NVA Epic on Modern SAN. NetApp also is the leader in independent testing by SPC.

Epic workloads are between 1K to 2K IOPS/TB; however, these are not extreme workloads. So why is performance an important consideration?

* Consolidation for medium and small customers

* Given the performance scale ONTAP can achieve, you can consolidate a lot more workloads onto less hardware:

* ONTAP guarantees a consistent floor performance level for each workload

* Software upgrades:

* Every upgrade of ONTAP has a proven history of not only adding features but also increased storage efficiency, increased performance headroom and lower latency; millage will vary but we have seen increases from 20–40% per upgrade

* Nondisruptive upgrades can extend the life of your storage investment from 3 years to 5 or 6 years

* Cost:

* All the above adds up to lower cost and higher efficiency


One of the major challenges in healthcare is the inefficiency of siloed environments. Multiple point solutions are created by various groups that impedes progress. Having a unified strategy to data management brings efficiency to accelerate transformation. Disruptive technology like digitizing patient records, Ransomware, and generative AI all the drive the need for consolidation.

With ONTAP you can consolidate file/block/object and each of your tier 0/1/2/3 workloads on premises and in the cloud today.

== Efficiency

Epic runs on all-flash arrays where most of the cost is the disk. Therefore, storage efficiency is critical for cost savings. NetApp offers a written efficiency guarantee with the all-flash arrays. When calculating storage efficiency, it is important to measure raw to usable to effective capacity. Figure 4 illustrates how NetApp inline storage efficiency achieves industry-leading savings on storage with no effects to performance:

* Raw capacity. Before any RAID is applied, size of disk by number of disks.

* Usable capacity. After RAID is applied, how much usable storage is available.

* Effective capacity. How much storage is provisioned and presented to the host or client.

Figure 4 is a sample efficiency calculation of a typical Epic deployment including all workloads requiring 852TB of effective storage and with 5.2:1 efficiency delivering 1.32PB of total effective data. 

Note: Based on the number of disks, raw-to-usable capacity varies slightly.

Note: NetApp does not use NetApp Snapshot™ technology or thin provisioning to calculate efficiencies. Doing so would show unrealistic efficiencies of 30–100:1, which do not mean anything when sizing storage capacity.
