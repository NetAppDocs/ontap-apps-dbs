PostgreSQL comes with variants that include PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL Plus, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). PostgreSQL is typically deployed as the back-end database for multitier applications. It is supported by common middleware packages (such as PHP, Java, Python, Tcl/Tk, ODBC, and JDBC) and has historically been a popular choice for open-source database management systems. ONTAP is a excellent choice for running PostgreSQL databases do to its reliability, high performing and efficent data management capabilities.

[NOTE]
This documentation on ONTAP and the PostgreSQL database replaces the previously published _TR-4770: PostgreSQL database on ONTAP best practices._

As data grows exponentially, data management becomes more complex for enterprises. This complexity increases licensing, operational, support, and maintenance costs. To reduce the overall TCO, consider switching from commercial to open-source databases with reliable, high-performing back-end storage. 

ONTAP is an ideal platform because ONTAP is literally designed for databases. Numerous features such as random IO latency optimizations to advanced quality of service (QoS) to basic FlexClone functionality were created specifically to address the needs of database workloads.

Additional features such as nondisruptive upgrades, (including storage replacement) ensure that your critical databases remain available. You can also have instant disaster recovery for large environments through MetroCluster, or select databases using SnapMirror active sync. 

Most importantly, ONTAP delivers unmatched performance with the ability to size the solution for your unique needs. Our high-end systems can deliver over 1M IOPS with latencies measured in microseconds, but if you only need 100K IOPS you can rightsize your storage solution with a smaller controller that still runs the exact same storage operating system.
