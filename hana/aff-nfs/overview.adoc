[.lead]
The NetApp AFF system product family has been certified for use with SAP HANA in tailored data center integration (TDI) projects. The certified enterprise storage system is characterized by the NetApp ONTAP software.

This certification is valid for the following models:

* AFF A150, AFF A220, AFF A250, AFF A300, AFF A320, AFF A400, AFF A700s, AFF A700, AFF A800, AFF A900

A complete list of NetApp certified storage solutions for SAP HANA can be found at the https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:13[Certified and supported SAP HANA hardware directory^].

[NOTE]
This section is based on TR-4435: SAP HANA on NetApp AFF Systems with NFS - Configuration Guide
[NOTE]
The configuration described in this paper is necessary to achieve the required SAP HANA KPIs and the best performance for SAP HANA. Changing any settings or using features not listed herein might cause performance degradation or unexpected behavior and should only be done if advised by NetApp support.

== Introduction
This document describes the ONTAP configuration requirements for the NFS protocol version 3 (NFSv3) or the NFS protocol version 4 (NFSv4.1).

The following table shows the supported combinations for NFS versions, NFS locking, and the required isolation implementations, depending on the SAP HANA database configuration.

For SAP HANA single-host systems or multiple hosts that do not use Host Auto-Failover, NFSv3 and NFSv4 are supported.

For SAP HANA multiple host systems with Host Auto-Failover, NetApp only supports NFSv4, while using NFSv4 locking as an alternative to a server-specific STONITH (SAP HANA HA/DR provider) implementation.

|SAP HANA |NFS version |NFS locking |SAP HANA HA/DR provider

[NOTE]
A server-specific STONITH implementation is not part of this guide. Contact your server vendor for such an implementation.

This document covers configuration recommendations for SAP HANA running on physical servers and on virtual servers that use VMware vSphere.

[NOTE]
See the relevant SAP notes for operating system configuration guidelines and HANA-specific Linux kernel dependencies. For more information, see SAP note 2235581: SAP HANA Supported Operating Systems.

== SAP HANA tailored data center integration

NetApp AFF storage controllers are certified in the SAP HANA TDI program using both NFS (NAS) and FC (SAN) protocols. They can be deployed in any of the current SAP HANA scenarios, such as SAP Business Suite on HANA, S/4HANA, BW/4HANA, or SAP Business Warehouse on HANA in either single-host or multiple-host configurations. Any server that is certified for use with SAP HANA can be combined with NetApp certified storage solutions. See the following figure for an architecture overview of SAP HANA TDI.

== SAP HANA using VMware vSphere

There are several options for connecting storage to virtual machines (VMs). The preferred option is to connect the storage volumes with NFS directly out of the guest operating system. Using this option, the configuration of hosts and storage does not differ between physical hosts and VMs.

NFS datastores and VVOL datastores with NFS are supported as well. For both options, only one SAP HANA data or log volume must be stored within the datastore for production use cases. In addition, Snapshot-based backup and recovery orchestrated by NetApp SnapCenter and solutions based on this, such as SAP System cloning, cannot be implemented.

This document describes the recommended setup with direct NFS mounts from the guest OS.
