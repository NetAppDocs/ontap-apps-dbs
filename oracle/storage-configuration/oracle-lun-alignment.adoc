LUN alignment refers to optimizing I/O with respect to the underlying file system layout.

Also see the discussion about compression block alignment in the section link:/oracle/ontap-configuration/oracle-efficiency.html[Efficiency]. Any layout that is aligned with 8KB compression block boundaries is also aligned with 4KB boundaries.

Alignment in Solaris environments is more complicated. Refer to http://support.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=61343[ONTAP SAN Host Configuration^] for more information.

|Caution

|In Solaris x86 environments, take additional care about proper alignment because most configurations have several layers of partitions. Solaris x86 partition slices usually exist on top of a standard master boot record partition table.
