= Performance

NetApp is a clear leader in the storage industry as seen in the published performance results in the NVA Epic on Modern SAN. NetApp also is the leader in independent testing by SPC.

Epic workloads are between 1K to 2K IOPS/TB; however, these are not extreme workloads. So why is performance an important consideration?

* Consolidation for medium and small customers

* Given the performance scale ONTAP can achieve, you can consolidate a lot more workloads onto less hardware:

* ONTAP guarantees a consistent floor performance level for each workload

* Software upgrades:

* Every upgrade of ONTAP has a proven history of not only adding features but also increased storage efficiency, increased performance headroom and lower latency; millage will vary but we have seen increases from 20â€“40% per upgrade

* Nondisruptive upgrades can extend the life of your storage investment from 3 years to 5 or 6 years

* Cost:

* All the above adds up to lower cost and higher efficiency
