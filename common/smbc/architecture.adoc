== Path Access

SM-BC makes storage devices visible to host operating systems from both the primary and remote storage arrays. Paths are managed through asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA), which is an industry standard protocol for identifying optimized paths between a storage system and a host.

The device path that is the shortest to access I/O is considered Active/Optimized paths and the rest of the paths are considered Active/Nonoptimized paths. 

As shown below, the SM-BC relationship is between a pair of SVMs located on different clusters. Both SVMs are capable of serving data, but ALUA will preferantially use the SVM that currently has ownership of the drives on which the LUNs reside. IO to the remote SVM will be proxied across the SM-BC interconnect.

== Storage Hardware

Unlike other storage disaster recovery solutions, SM-BC offers asymmetric platform flexibilityâ€”the hardware at each site does not need to be identical. This capability allows you to right-size the hardware used to support SM-BC. The remote storage system can be identical to the primary site if it needs to support a full production workload, but if a disaster results in reduced I/O, than a smaller system at the remote site might be more cost-effective.

== ONTAP Mediator

The ONTAP Mediator is a software application that is downloaded from NetApp support. Mediator automates failover operations for both the primary and remote site storage cluster. It can be deployed on a small virtual machine (VM) hosted either on-premises or in the cloud. After it is configured, it acts as a third site to monitor failover scenarios for both the sites.
