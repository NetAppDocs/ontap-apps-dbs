[.lead]
FlexClone technology can be leveraged both at the primary storage system and at the SnapMirror destination for effective utilization of resources. 

lexClone can also be used for disaster recovery testing without affecting the operational continuity of the SQL Server environment.

SQL Server requires either a consistency group snapshot of the entire database, including all datafiles and logs, or an application-consistent snapshot to create FlexClone volumes based on a Snapshot. NetApp recommends using SnapCenter to create snapshots. For more details about the SQL Server Plug-in for SnapCenter, see TR-4714: Best Practice Guide for SQL Server Using NetApp SnapCenter.
