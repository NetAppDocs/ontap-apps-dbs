[.lead]
Accurate testing of database storage performance is an extremely complicated subject. It requires an understanding of the following issues:

* IOPS and throughput
* The difference between foreground and background I/O operations
* The effect of latency upon the database
* Numerous OS and network settings that also affect storage performance

In addition, there are nonstorage databases tasks to consider. There is a point at which optimizing storage performance yields no useful benefits because storage performance is no longer a limiting factor for performance.

A majority of database customers now select all-flash arrays, which creates some additional considerations. For example, consider performance testing on a two-node AFF8080 system:

* With a 75/25 read/write ratio, two AFF8080 nodes can deliver over 300K random database IOPS before latency even crosses the 1ms mark. This is so far beyond the current performance demands of most databases that it is difficult to predict the expected improvement. Storage would be largely erased as a bottleneck.
* Network bandwidth is an increasingly common source of performance limitations. For example, spinning disk solutions are often bottlenecks for database performance because the I/O latency is very high. When latency limitations are removed by an all-flash array, the barrier frequently shifts to the network. This is especially notable with virtualized environments and blade systems where the true network connectivity is difficult to visualize. This can complicate performance testing if the storage system itself cannot be fully utilized due to bandwidth limitations.
* Comparing the performance of an all-flash array with an array containing spinning disks is generally not possible because of the dramatically improved latency of all-flash arrays. Test results are typically not meaningful.
* Comparing peak IOPS performance with an all-flash array is frequently not a useful test because databases are not limited by storage I/O. For example, assume one array can sustain 500K random IOPS, whereas another can sustain 300K. The difference is irrelevant in the real world if a database is spending 99% of its time on CPU processing. The workloads never utilize the full capabilities of the storage array. In contrast, peak IOPS capabilities might be critical in a consolidation platform in which the storage array is expected to be loaded to its peak capabilities.
* Always consider latency as well as IOPS in any storage test. Many storage arrays in the market make claims of extreme levels of IOPS, but the latency renders those IOPS useless at such levels. The typical target with all-flash arrays is the 1ms mark. A better approach to testing is not to measure the maximum possible IOPS, but to determine how many IOPS a storage array can sustain before average latency is greater than 1ms.

== Oracle Automatic Workload Repository and benchmarking
The gold standard for Oracle performance comparisons is an Oracle Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) report.

There are multiple types of AWR reports. From a storage point of view, a report generated by running the `awrrpt.sql` command is the most comprehensive and valuable because it targets a specific database instance and includes some detailed histograms that break down storage I/O events based on latency.

Comparing two performance arrays ideally involves running the same workload on each array and producing an AWR report that precisely targets the workload. In the case of a very long-running workload, a single AWR report with an elapsed time that encompasses the start and stop time can be used, but it is preferable to break out the AWR data as multiple reports. For example, if a batch job ran from midnight to 6 a.m., create a series of one-hour AWR reports from midnight–1 a.m., 1 a.m.–2 a.m., and so on.

In other cases, a very short query should be optimized. The best option is an AWR report based on an AWR snapshot created when the query begins and a second AWR snapshot created when the query ends. The database server should be otherwise quiet to minimize the background activity that would obscure the activity of the query under analysis.

[NOTE]
Where AWR reports are not available, Oracle statspack reports are a good alternative. They contain most of the same I/O statistics as an AWR report.

== Oracle AWR and troubleshooting
An AWR report is also the most important tool for analyzing a performance problem.

As with benchmarking, performance troubleshooting requires that you precisely measure a particular workload. When possible, provide AWR data when reporting a performance problem to the NetApp support center or when working with a NetApp or partner account team about a new solution.

When providing AWR data, consider the following requirements:

* Run the `awrrpt.sql` command to generate the report. The output can be either text or HTML.
* If Oracle Real Application Clusters (RACs) are used, generate AWR reports for each instance in the cluster.
* Target the specific time the problem existed. The maximum acceptable elapsed time of an AWR report is generally one hour. If a problem persists for multiple hours or involves a multihour operation such as a batch job, provide multiple one-hour AWR reports that cover the entire period to be analyzed.
* If possible, adjust the AWR snapshot interval to 15 minutes. This setting allows a more detailed analysis to be performed. This also requires additional executions of `awrrpt.sql` to provide a report for each 15-minute interval.
* If the problem is a very short running query, provide an AWR report based on an AWR snapshot created when the operation begins and a second AWR snapshot created when the operation ends. The database server should be otherwise quiet to minimize the background activity that would obscure the activity of the operation under analysis.
* If a performance problem is reported at certain times but not others, provide additional AWR data that demonstrates good performance for comparison.

== calibrate_io
The `calibrate_io` command should never be used to test, compare, or benchmark storage systems. As stated in the Oracle documentation, this procedure calibrates the I/O capabilities of storage.

Calibration is not the same as benchmarking. The purpose of this command is to issue I/O to help calibrate database operations and improve their efficiency by optimizing the level of I/O issued to the host. Because the type of I/O performed by the `calibrate_io` operation does not represent actual database user I/O, the results are not predictable and are frequently not even reproducible.

== SLOB2
SLOB2, the Silly Little Oracle Benchmark, has become the preferred tool for evaluating database performance. It was developed by Kevin Closson and is available at link:https://kevinclosson.net/slob/[https://kevinclosson.net/slob/^]. It takes minutes to install and configure, and it uses an actual Oracle database to generate I/O patterns on a user-definable tablespace. It is one of the few testing options available that can saturate an all-flash array with I/O. It is also useful for generating much lower levels of I/O to simulate storage workloads that are low IOPS but latency sensitive.

== Swingbench
Swingbench can be useful for testing database performance, but it is extremely difficult to use Swingbench in a way that stresses storage. NetApp has not seen any tests from Swingbench that yielded enough I/O to be a significant load on any AFF array. In limited cases, the Order Entry Test (OET) can be used to evaluate storage from a latency point of view. This could be useful in situations where a database has a known latency dependency for particular queries. Care must be taken to make sure that the host and network are properly configured to realize the latency potentials of an all-flash array.

== HammerDB
HammerDB is a database testing tool that simulates TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks, among others. It can take a lot of time to construct a sufficiently large data set to properly execute a test, but it can be an effective tool for evaluating performance for OLTP and data warehouse applications.

== Orion
The Oracle Orion tool was commonly used with Oracle 9, but it has not been maintained to ensure compatibility with changes in various host operation systems. It is rarely used with Oracle 10 or Oracle 11 due to incompatibilities with OS and storage configuration.

Oracle rewrote the tool, and it is installed by default with Oracle 12c. Although this product has been improved and uses many of the same calls that a real Oracle database uses, it does not use precisely the same code path or I/O behavior used by Oracle. For example, most Oracle I/Os are performed synchronously, meaning the database halts until the I/O is complete as the I/O operation completes in the foreground. Simply flooding a storage system with random I/Os is not a reproduction of real Oracle I/O and does not offer a direct method of comparing storage arrays or measuring the effect of configuration changes.

That said, there are some use cases for Orion, such as general measurement of the maximum possible performance of a particular host-network-storage configuration, or to gauge the health of a storage system. With careful testing, usable Orion tests could be devised to compare storage arrays or evaluate the effect of a configuration change so long as the parameters include consideration of IOPS, throughput, and latency and attempt to faithfully replicate a realistic workload.
