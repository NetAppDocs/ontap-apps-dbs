= Set up the SVM

NetApp virtualizes storage, and user access is provided by the SVM. For Epic, there is an FCP SVM and a CIFC SVM. Depending on how you want to manage your storage, and possibly multitenancy, you can use more SVMs. 

To set up an SVM: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_svms.html
