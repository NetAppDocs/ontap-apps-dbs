MetroCluster has many specific data protection and availability features.

For a complete review of general ONTAP data protection features, see the data protection documents, including link:../dp/availability.html[Data Availability] and link:../dp/integrity.html[Data Integrity].

== Site failure protection: NVRAM and MetroCluster
MetroCluster extends NVRAM data protection in the following ways:

* In a two-node configuration, NVRAM data is replicated using the Inter-Switch Links (ISLs) to the remote partner.
* In an HA-pair configuration, NVRAM data is replicated to both the local partner and a remote partner.
* A write is not acknowledged until it is replicated to all partners. This architecture protects in-flight I/O from site failure by replicating NVRAM data to a remote partner. This process is not involved with drive-level data replication. The controller that owns the aggregates is responsible for data replication by writing to both plexes in the aggregate, but there still must be protection against in-flight I/O loss in the event of site loss. Replicated NVRAM data is only used if a partner controller must take over for a failed controller.

== Site and shelf failure protection: SyncMirror and plexes
SyncMirror is a mirroring technology that enhances, but does not replace, RAID DP or RAID-TEC. It mirrors the contents of two independent RAID groups. The logical configuration is as follows:

. Drives are configured into two pools based on location. One pool is composed of all drives on site A, and the second pool is composed of all drives on site B.
. A common pool of storage, known as an aggregate, is then created based on mirrored sets of RAID groups. An equal number of drives is drawn from each site. For example, a 20-drive SyncMirror aggregate would be composed of 10 drives from site A and 10 drives from site B.
. Each set of drives on a given site is automatically configured as one or more fully redundant RAID DP or RAID-TEC groups, independent of the use of mirroring. This use of RAID underneath mirroring provides data protection even after the loss of a site.

The figure above illustrates a sample SyncMirror configuration. A 24-drive aggregate was created on the controller with 12 drives from a shelf allocated on site A and 12 drives from a shelf allocated on site B. The drives were grouped into two mirrored RAID groups. RAID group 0 includes a 6-drive plex on site A mirrored to a 6-drive plex on site B. Likewise, RAID group 1 includes a 6-drive plex on site A mirrored to a 6-drive plex on site B.

SyncMirror is normally used to provide remote mirroring with MetroCluster systems, with one copy of the data at each site. On occasion, it has been used to provide an extra level of redundancy in a single system. In particular, it provides shelf-level redundancy. A drive shelf already contains dual power supplies and controllers and is overall little more than sheet metal, but in some cases the extra protection might be warranted. For example, one NetApp customer has deployed SyncMirror for a mobile real-time analytics platform used during automotive testing. The system was separated into two physical racks supplied with independent power feeds and independent UPS systems.

== Redundancy failure: NVFAIL
As discussed earlier, a write is not acknowledged until it has been logged into local NVRAM and NVRAM on at least one other controller. This approach makes sure that a hardware failure or power outage does not result in the loss of in-flight I/O. If the local NVRAM fails or the connectivity to other nodes fails, then data would no longer be mirrored.

If the local NVRAM reports an error, the node shuts down. This shutdown results in failover to a partner controller when HA pairs are used. With MetroCluster, the behavior depends on the overall configuration chosen, but it can result in automatic failover to the remote note. In any case, no data is lost because the controller experiencing the failure has not acknowledged the write operation.

A site-to-site connectivity failure that blocks NVRAM replication to remote nodes is a more complicated situation. Writes are no longer replicated to the remote nodes, creating a possibility of data loss if a catastrophic error occurs on a controller. More importantly, attempting to fail over to a different node during these conditions results in data loss.

The controlling factor is whether NVRAM is synchronized. If NVRAM is synchronized, node-to-node failover is safe to proceed without risk of data loss. In a MetroCluster configuration, if NVRAM and the underlying aggregate plexes are in sync, it is safe to proceed with switchover without risk of data loss.

ONTAP does not permit a failover or switchover when the data is out of sync unless the failover or switchover is forced. Forcing a change in conditions in this manner acknowledges that data might be left behind in the original controller and that data loss is acceptable.

Databases and other applications are especially vulnerable to corruption if a failover or switchover is forced because they maintain larger internal caches of data on disk. If a forced failover or switchover occurs, previously acknowledged changes are effectively discarded. The contents of the storage array effectively jump backward in time, and the state of the cache no longer reflects the state of the data on disk.

To prevent this situation, ONTAP allows volumes to be configured for special protection against NVRAM failure. When triggered, this protection mechanism results in a volume entering a state called NVFAIL. This state results in I/O errors that cause an application crash. This crash causes the applications to shut down so that they do not use stale data. Data should not be lost because any committed transaction data should be present in the logs. The usual next steps are for an administrator to fully shut down the hosts before manually placing the LUNs and volumes back online again. Although these steps can involve some work, this approach is the safest way to make sure of data integrity. Not all data requires this protection, which is why NVFAIL behavior can be configured on a volume-by-volume basis.

=== HA pairs and MetroCluster
MetroCluster is available in two configurations: two-node and HA pair. The two-node configuration behaves the same as an HA pair with respect to NVRAM. In the event of sudden failure, the partner node can replay NVRAM data to make the drives consistent and make sure that no acknowledged writes have been lost.

The HA-pair configuration replicates NVRAM to the local partner node as well. A simple controller failure results in an NVRAM replay on the partner node, as is the case with a standalone HA-pair without MetroCluster. In the event of sudden complete site loss, the remote site also has the NVRAM required to make the drives consistent and start serving data.

One important aspect of MetroCluster is that the remote nodes have no access to partner data under normal operational conditions. Each site functions essentially as an independent system that can assume the personality of the opposite site. This process is known as a switchover and includes a planned switchover in which site operations are migrated nondisruptively to the opposite site. It also includes unplanned situations in which a site is lost and a manual or automatic switchover is required as part of disaster recovery.

== Switchover and switchback
The terms switchover and switchback refer to the process of transitioning volumes between remote controllers in a MetroCluster configuration. This process only applies to the remote nodes. When MetroCluster is used in a four-volume configuration, local node failover is the same takeover and giveback process described previously.

=== Planned switchover and switchback
A planned switchover or switchback is similar to a takeover or giveback between nodes. The process has multiple steps and might appear to require several minutes, but what is actually happening is a multiphase graceful transition of storage and network resources. The moment when control transfers occurs much more quickly than the time required for the complete command to execute.

The primary difference between takeover/giveback and switchover/switchback is with the effect on FC SAN connectivity. With local takeover/giveback, a host experiences the loss of all FC paths to the local node and relies on its native MPIO to change over to available alternate paths. Ports are not relocated. With switchover and switchback, the virtual FC target ports on the controllers transition to the other site. They effectively cease to exist on the SAN for a moment and then reappear on an alternate controller.

=== SyncMirror timeouts
SyncMirror is a ONTAP mirroring technology that provides protection against shelf failures. When shelves are separated across a distance, the result is remote data protection.

SyncMirror does not deliver universal synchronous mirroring. The result is better availability. Some storage systems use constant all-or-nothing mirroring, sometimes called domino mode. This form of mirroring is limited in application because all write activity must cease if the connection to the remote site is lost. Otherwise, a write would exist at one site but not at the other. Typically, such environments are configured to take LUNs offline if site-to-site connectivity is lost for more than a short period (such as 30 seconds).

This behavior is desirable for a small subset of environments. However, most applications require a solution that delivers guaranteed synchronous replication under normal operating conditions, but with the ability to suspend replication. A complete loss of site-to-site connectivity is frequently considered a near-disaster situation. Typically, such environments are kept online and serving data until connectivity is repaired or a formal decision is made to shut down the environment to protect data. A requirement for automatic shutdown of the application purely because of remote replication failure is unusual.

SyncMirror supports synchronous mirroring requirements with the flexibility of a timeout. If connectivity to the remote controller and/or plex is lost, a 30- second timer begins counting down. When the counter reaches 0, write I/O processing resumes using the local data. The remote copy of the data is usable, but it is frozen in time until connectivity is restored. Resynchronization leverages aggregate-level snapshots to return the system to synchronous mode as quickly as possible.

Notably, in many cases, this sort of universal all-or-nothing domino mode replication is better implemented at the application layer. For example, Oracle DataGuard includes maximum protection mode, which guarantees long-instance replication under all circumstances. If the replication link fails for a period exceeding a configurable timeout, the databases shut down.

=== Automatic unattended switchover with Fabric Attached MetroCluster
Automatic unattended switchover (AUSO) is a Fabric Attached MetroCluster feature that delivers a form of cross-site HA. As discussed previously, MetroCluster is available in two types: a single controller on each site or an HA pair on each site. The principal advantage of the HA option is that planned or unplanned controller shutdown still allows all I/O to be local. The advantage of the single-node option is reduced costs, complexity, and infrastructure.

The primary value of AUSO is to improve the HA capabilities of Fabric Attached MetroCluster systems. Each site monitors the health of the opposite site, and, if no nodes remain to serve data, AUSO results in rapid switchover. This approach is especially useful in MetroCluster configurations with just a single node per site because it brings the configuration closer to an HA pair in terms of availability.

// Is this still true as MAUSO does offer 
AUSO cannot offer comprehensive monitoring at the level of an HA pair. An HA pair can deliver extremely high availability because it includes two redundant physical cables for direct node-to-node communication. Furthermore, both nodes in an HA pair have access to the same set of disks on redundant loops, delivering another route for one node to monitor the health of another.

MetroCluster clusters exist across sites for which both node-to-node communication and disk access rely on the site-to-site network connectivity. The ability to monitor the heartbeat of the rest of the cluster is limited. AUSO has to discriminate between a situation where the other site is actually down rather than unavailable due to a network problem.

As a result, a controller in an HA pair can prompt a takeover if it detects a controller failure that occurred for a specific reason, such as a system panic. It can also prompt a takeover if there is a complete loss of connectivity, sometimes known as a lost heartbeat.

A MetroCluster system can only safely perform an automatic switchover when a specific fault is detected on the original site. Also, the controller taking ownership of the storage system must be able to guarantee that disk and NVRAM data is in sync. The controller cannot guarantee the safety of a switchover just because it lost contact with the source site, which could still be operational. For additional options for automating a switchover, see the information on the MetroCluster tiebreaker (MCTB) solution in the next section.

=== MetroCluster tiebreaker with fabric attached MetroCluster
The https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP12007400/html/GUID-3662A7CE-3AF2-4562-A11C-5C37DE0E3A87.html[NetApp MetroCluster Tiebreaker^] software can run on a third site to monitor the health of the MetroCluster environment, send notifications, and optionally force a switchover in a disaster situation. A complete description of the tiebreaker can be found on the http://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp support site^], but the primary purpose of the MetroCluster Tiebreaker is to detect site loss. It must also discriminate between site loss and a loss of connectivity. For example, switchover should not occur because the tiebreaker was unable to reach the primary site, which is why the tiebreaker also monitors the remote site's ability to contact the primary site.

Automatic switchover with AUSO is also compatible with the MCTB. AUSO reacts very quickly because it is designed to detect specific failure events and then invoke the switchover only when NVRAM and SyncMirror plexes are in sync.

In contrast, the tiebreaker is located remotely and therefore must wait for a timer to elapse before declaring a site dead. The tiebreaker eventually detects the sort of controller failure covered by AUSO, but in general AUSO has already started the switchover and possibly completed the switchover before the tiebreaker acts. The resulting second switchover command coming from the tiebreaker would be rejected.

*Caution: *The MCTB software does not verify that NVRAM was and/or plexes are in sync when forcing a switchover. Automatic switchover, if configured, should be disabled during maintenance activities that result in loss of sync for NVRAM or SyncMirror plexes.

Additionally, the MCTB might not address a rolling disaster that leads to the following sequence of events:

. Connectivity between sites is interrupted for more than 30 seconds.
. SyncMirror replication times out, and operations continue on the primary site, leaving the remote replica stale.
. The primary site is lost.The result is the presence of unreplicated changes on the primary site. A switchover might then be undesirable for a number of reasons, including the following:

* Critical data might be present on the primary site, and that data might be eventually recoverable. A switchover that allowed the application to continue operating would effectively discard that critical data.
* An application on the surviving site that was using storage resources on the primary site at the time of site loss might have cached data. A switchover would introduce a stale version of the data that does not match the cache.
* An operating system on the surviving site that was using storage resources on the primary site at the time of site loss might have cached data. A switchover would introduce a stale version of the data that does not match the cache. The safest option is to configure the tiebreaker to send an alert if it detects site failure and then have a person make a decision on whether to force a switchover. Applications and/or operating systems might first need to be shut down to clear any cached data. In addition, the NVFAIL settings can be used to add further protection and help streamline the failover process.

=== ONTAP Mediator with MetroCluster IP
The ONTAP Mediator is used with MetroCluster IP and certain other ONTAP solutions. It functions as a traditional tiebreaker service, much like the MetroCluster Tiebreaker software discussed above, but also includes a critical feature – performing automated unattended switchover.

A fabric-attached MetroCluster has direct access to the storage devices on the opposite site. This allows one MetroCluster controller to monitor the health of the other controllers by reading heartbeat data from the drives. This allows one controller to recognize the failure of another controller and perform a switchover.

In contrast, the MetroCluster IP architecture routes all I/O exclusively through the controller-controller connection; there is no direct access to storage devices on the remote site. This limits the ability of a controller to detect failures and perform a switchover. The ONTAP Mediator is therefore required as a tiebreaker device to detect site loss and automatically perform a switchover.

=== Virtual third site with ClusterLion
ClusterLion is an advanced MetroCluster monitoring appliance that functions as a virtual third site. This approach allows MetroCluster to be safely deployed in a two-site configuration with fully automated switchover capability. Furthermore, ClusterLion can perform additional network level monitor and execute post-switchover operations. Complete documentation is available from ProLion.

* The ClusterLion appliances monitor the health of the controllers with directly connected Ethernet and serial cables.
* The two appliances are connected to each other with redundant 3G wireless connections.
* Power to the ONTAP controller is routed through internal relays. In the event of a site failure, ClusterLion, which contains an internal UPS system, cuts the power connections before invoking a switchover. This process makes sure that no split-brain condition occurs.
* ClusterLion performs a switchover within the 30-second SyncMirror timeout or not at all.
* ClusterLion does not perform a switchover unless the states of NVRAM and SyncMirror plexes are in sync.
* Because ClusterLion only performs a switchover if MetroCluster is fully in sync, NVFAIL is not required. This configuration permits site-spanning environments such as an extended Oracle RAC to remain online, even during an unplanned switchover.
* Support includes both Fabric-attached MetroCluster and MetroCluster IP
