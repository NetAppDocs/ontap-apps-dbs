[.lead]
As with database-level migration, migration at the host layer provides a storage vendorâ€“independent approach.

In other words, sometime "just copy the files" is the best option.

Although this low-tech approach might seem too basic, it does offer significant benefits because no special software is required and the original data remains safely untouched during the process. The primary limitation is the fact that a file-copy data migration is a disruptive process, because the database must be shut down before the copy operation begins. There is no good way to synchronize changes within a file, so the files must be completely quiesced before copying begins.

If the shutdown required by a copy operation is not desirable, the next best host-based option is leveraging a logical volume manager (LVM). Many LVM options exist, including Oracle ASM, all with similar capabilities, but also with some limitations that must be taken into account. In most cases, the migration can be accomplished without downtime and disruption.

== Filesystem to filesystem copying

The usefulness of a simple copy operation should not be underestimated. This operation requires downtime during the copy process, but it is a highly reliable process and requires no special expertise with operating systems, databases, or storage systems. Furthermore, it is very safe because it does not affect the original data. Typically, a system administrator changes the source file systems to be mounted as read-only and then reboots a server to guarantee that nothing can damage the current data. The copy process can be scripted to make sure that it runs as quickly as possible without risk of user error. Because the type of I/O is a simple sequential transfer of data, it is highly bandwidth efficient.

The following example demonstrates one option for a safe and rapid migration.

=== Environment
The environment to be migrated is as follows:

* Current file systems
+
....
ontap-nfs1:/host1_oradata       52428800  16196928  36231872  31% /oradata
ontap-nfs1:/host1_logs          49807360    548032  49259328   2% /logs
....

* New file systems
+
....
ontap-nfs1:/host1_logs_new      49807360       128  49807232   1% /new/logs
ontap-nfs1:/host1_oradata_new   49807360       128  49807232   1% /new/oradata
....

==== Overview
The database can be migrated by a DBA by simply shutting down the database and copying the files, but the process is easily scripted if many databases must be migrated or minimizing downtime is critical. The use of scripts also reduces the chance for user error.

The example scripts shown automate the following operations:

* Shutting down the database
* Converting the existing file systems to a read-only state
* Copying all data from the source to target file systems, which preserves all file permissions
* Unmounting the old and new file systems
* Remounting the new file systems at the same paths as the prior file systems

=== Procedure
. Shut down the database.

=== Fully automated cutover
This sample script accepts arguments of the database SID followed by common-delimited pairs of file systems. For the example shown above, the command is issued as follows:

....
[root@host1 current]# ./migrate.oracle.fs.pl NTAP /logs,/new/logs /oradata,/new/oradata
....

When executed, the example script attempts to perform the following sequence. It terminates if it encounters an error in any step:

. Shut down the database.
. Convert the current file systems to read-only status.
. Use each comma-delimited pair of file system arguments and synchronize the first file system to the second.
. Dismount the prior file systems.
. Update the `/etc/fstab` file as follows:
.. Create a backup at `/etc/fstab.bak`.
.. Comment out the prior entries for the prior and new file systems.
.. Create a new entry for the new file system that uses the old mountpoint.
. Mount the file systems.
. Start the database.

The following text provides an execution example for this script:

....

== Oracle ASM spfile and passwd migration
One difficulty in completing migration involving ASM is the ASM-specific spfile and the password file. By default, these critical metadata files are created on the first ASM disk group defined. If a particular ASM disk group must be evacuated and removed, the spfile and password file that govern that ASM instance must be relocated.

Another use case in which these files might need to be relocated is during a deployment of database management software such as SnapManager for Oracle or the SnapCenter Oracle plug- in. One of the features of these products is to rapidly restore a database by reverting the state of the ASM LUNs hosting the data files. Doing so requires taking the ASM disk group offline before performing a restore. This is not a problem as long as a given database's data files are isolated in a dedicated ASM disk group.

When that disk group also contains the ASM spfile/passwd file, the only way the disk group can be brought offline is to shut down the entire ASM instance. This is a disruptive process, which means that the spfile/passwd file would need to be relocated.

=== Environment
. Database SID = TOAST
. Current data files on `+DATA`
. Current logfiles and controlfiles on `+LOGS`
. New ASM disk groups established as `+NEWDATA` and `+NEWLOGS`

=== ASM spfile/passwd file locations
Relocating these files can be done nondisruptively. However, for safety, NetApp recommends shutting down the database environment so that you can be certain that the files have been relocated and the configuration is properly updated. This procedure must be repeated if multiple ASM instances are present on a server.

==== Identify ASM instances
Identify the ASM instances based on the data recorded in the `oratab` file. The ASM instances are denoted by a + symbol.

....
-bash-4.1$ cat /etc/oratab | grep '^+'
+ASM:/orabin/grid:N             # line added by Agent
....

There is one ASM instance called +ASM on this server.

==== Make sure all databases are shut down
The only smon process visible should be the smon for the ASM instance in use. The presence of another smon process indicates that a database is still running.

....
-bash-4.1$ ps -ef | grep smon
oracle     857     1  0 18:26 ?        00:00:00 asm_smon_+ASM
....

The only smon process is the ASM instance itself. This means that no other databases are running, and it is safe to proceed without risk of disrupting database operations.

==== Locate files
Identify the current location of the ASM spfile and password file by using the `spget` and `pwget` commands.

....
bash-4.1$ asmcmd
ASMCMD> spget
+DATA/spfile.ora
....

....
ASMCMD> pwget --asm
+DATA/orapwasm
....

The files are both located at the base of the `+DATA` disk group.

=== Copy files
Copy the files to the new ASM disk group with the `spcopy` and `pwcopy` commands. If the new disk group was recently created and is currently empty, it might need to be mounted first.

....
ASMCMD> mount NEWDATA
....

....
ASMCMD> spcopy +DATA/spfile.ora +NEWDATA/spfile.ora
copying +DATA/spfile.ora -> +NEWDATA/spfilea.ora
....

....
ASMCMD> pwcopy +DATA/orapwasm +NEWDATA/orapwasm
copying +DATA/orapwasm -> +NEWDATA/orapwasm
....

The files have now been copied from `+DATA` to `+NEWDATA`.

==== Update ASM instance
The ASM instance must now be updated to reflect the change in location. The `spset` and `pwset` commands update the ASM metadata required for starting the ASM disk group.

....
ASMCMD> spset +NEWDATA/spfile.ora
ASMCMD> pwset --asm +NEWDATA/orapwasm
....

==== Activate ASM using updated files
At this point, the ASM instance still uses the prior locations of these files. The instance must be restarted to force a reread of the files from their new locations and to release locks on the prior files.

....
-bash-4.1$ sqlplus / as sysasm
SQL> shutdown immediate;
ASM diskgroups volume disabled
ASM diskgroups dismounted
ASM instance shutdown
....

....
SQL> startup
ASM instance started

ORA-15017: diskgroup "NEWDATA" cannot be mounted
ORA-15013: diskgroup "NEWDATA" is already mounted
....

==== Remove old spfile and password files
If the procedure has been performed successfully, the prior files are no longer locked and can now be removed.

....
-bash-4.1$ asmcmd
ASMCMD> rm +DATA/spfile.ora
ASMCMD> rm +DATA/orapwasm
....

== Oracle ASM to ASM copy
Oracle ASM is essentially a lightweight combined volume manager and file system. Because the file system is not readily visible, RMAN must be used to perform copy operations. Although a copy-based migration process is safe and simple, it results in some disruption. The disruption can be minimized, but not fully eliminated.

If you want nondisruptive migration of an ASM-based database, the best option is to leverage ASM's capability to rebalance ASM extents to new LUNs while dropping the old LUNs. Doing so is generally safe and nondisruptive to operations, but it offers no back- out path. If functional or performance problems are encountered, the only option is to migrate the data back to the source.

This risk can be avoided by copying the database to the new location rather than moving data, so that the original data is untouched. The database can be fully tested in its new location before going live, and the original database is available as a fall- back option if problems are found.

This procedure is one of many options involving RMAN. It is designed to allow a two-step process in which the initial backup is created and then later synchronized through log replay. This process is desirable to minimize downtime because it allows the database to remain operational and serving data during the initial baseline copy.

=== Copy database
Oracle RMAN creates a level 0 (complete) copy of the source database currently located on the ASM disk group `+DATA` to the new location on `+NEWDATA`.

....

=== Force archive log switch
You must force an archive log switch to make sure that the archive logs contain all data required to make the copy fully consistent. Without this command, key data might still be present in the redo logs.

....
RMAN> sql 'alter system archive log current';
sql statement: alter system archive log current
....

=== Shut down source database
Disruption begins in this step because the database is shut down and placed in a limited-access, read-only mode. To shut down the source database, run the following commands:

....
RMAN> shutdown immediate;
using target database control file instead of recovery catalog
database closed
database dismounted
Oracle instance shut down
RMAN> startup mount;
connected to target database (not started)

Redo Buffers                   5455872 bytes
....

=== Controlfile backup
You must back up the controlfile in case you must abort the migration and revert to the original storage location. A copy of the backup controlfile isn't 100% required, but it does make the process of resetting the database file locations back to the original location easier.

....
RMAN> backup as copy current controlfile format '/tmp/TOAST.ctrl';

Finished backup at 06-DEC-15
....

=== Parameter updates
The current spfile contains references to the controlfiles on their current locations within the old ASM disk group. It must be edited, which is easily done by editing an intermediate pfile version.

....
RMAN> create pfile='/tmp/pfile' from spfile;
Statement processed
....

==== Update pfile
Update any parameters referring to old ASM disk groups to reflect the new ASM disk group names. Then save the updated pfile. Make sure that the `db_create` parameters are present.

In the example below, the references to `+DATA` that were changed to `+NEWDATA` are highlighted in yellow. Two key parameters are the `db_create` parameters that create any new files at the correct location.

==== Update init.ora file
Most ASM-based databases use an `init.ora` file located in the `$ORACLE_HOME/dbs` directory, which is a point to the spfile on the ASM disk group. This file must be redirected to a location on the new ASM disk group.

....
-bash-4.1$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
-bash-4.1$ cat initTOAST.ora
SPFILE='+DATA/TOAST/spfileTOAST.ora'
....

Change this file as follows:

....
SPFILE=+NEWLOGS/TOAST/spfileTOAST.ora
....

==== Parameter file recreation
The spfile is now ready to be populated by the data in the edited pfile.

....
RMAN> create spfile from pfile='/tmp/pfile';
Statement processed
....

==== Start database to start using new spfile
Start the database to make sure that it now uses the newly created spfile and that any further changes to system parameters are correctly recorded.

....

=== Restore controlfile
The backup controlfile created by RMAN can also be restored by RMAN directly to the location specified in the new spfile.

....

=== Log replay
The database currently uses the data files in the old location. Before the copy can be used, they must be synchronized. Time has passed during the initial copy process, and the changes have been logged primarily in the archive logs. These changes are replicated as follows:

. Perform an RMAN incremental backup, which contains the archive logs.

....

=== Activation
The controlfile that was restored still references the data files at the original location, and it also contains the path information for the copied data files.

. To change the active data files, run the `switch database to copy` command.
+
....
RMAN> switch database to copy;
datafile 1 switched to datafile copy "+NEWDATA/TOAST/DATAFILE/system.259.897759609"
datafile 2 switched to datafile copy "+NEWDATA/TOAST/DATAFILE/sysaux.263.897759615"
datafile 3 switched to datafile copy "+NEWDATA/TOAST/DATAFILE/undotbs1.264.897759619"
datafile 4 switched to datafile copy "+NEWDATA/TOAST/DATAFILE/users.258.897759623"
....
+
The active data files are now the copied data files, but there still might be changes contained within the final redo logs.

. To replay all of the remaining logs, run the `recover database` command. If the message `media recovery complete` appears, the process was successful.
+
....
RMAN> recover database;
Starting recover at 06-DEC-15
using channel ORA_DISK_1
starting media recovery
media recovery complete, elapsed time: 00:00:01
Finished recover at 06-DEC-15
....
+
This process only changed the location of the normal data files. The temporary data files must be renamed, but they do not need to be copied because they are only temporary. The database is currently down, so there is no active data in the temporary data files.

. To relocate the temporary data files, first identify their location.
+
....
RMAN> select file#||' '||name from v$tempfile;
FILE#||''||NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 +DATA/TOAST/TEMPFILE/temp.263.897683145
....

. Relocate temporary data files by using an RMAN command that sets the new name for each data file. With Oracle Managed Files (OMF), the complete name is not necessary; the ASM disk group is sufficient. When the database is opened, OMF links to the appropriate location on the ASM disk group. To relocate files, run the following commands:
+
....
run {
set newname for tempfile 1 to '+NEWDATA';
switch tempfile all;
}
....
+
....
RMAN> run {
2> set newname for tempfile 1 to '+NEWDATA';
3> switch tempfile all;
4> }
executing command: SET NEWNAME
renamed tempfile 1 to +NEWDATA in control file
....

=== Redo log migration
The migration process is nearly complete, but the redo logs are still located on the original ASM disk group. Redo logs cannot be directly relocated. Instead, a new set of redo logs is created and added to the configuration, followed by a drop of the old logs.

. Identify the number of redo log groups and their respective group numbers.
+
....
RMAN> select group#||' '||member from v$logfile;
GROUP#||''||MEMBER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 +DATA/TOAST/ONLINELOG/group_1.261.897683139
2 +DATA/TOAST/ONLINELOG/group_2.259.897683139
3 +DATA/TOAST/ONLINELOG/group_3.256.897683139
....

. Enter the size of the redo logs.
+
....
RMAN> select group#||' '||bytes from v$log;
GROUP#||''||BYTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 52428800
2 52428800
3 52428800
....

. For each redo log, create a new group with a matching configuration. If you are not using OMF, you must specify the full path. This is also an example that uses the `db_create_online_log` parameters. As was shown previously, this parameter was set to +NEWLOGS. This configuration allows you to use the following commands to create new online logs without the need to specify a file location or even a specific ASM disk group.
+
....
RMAN> alter database add logfile size 52428800;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database add logfile size 52428800;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database add logfile size 52428800;
Statement processed
....

. Open the database.
+
....
SQL> alter database open;
Database altered.
....

. Drop the old logs.
+
....
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 1;
Statement processed
....

. If you encounter an error that prevents you from dropping an active log, force a switch to the next log to release the lock and force a global checkpoint. An example is shown below. The attempt to drop logfile group 3, which was located on the old location, was denied because there was still active data in this logfile. A log archiving following a checkpoint allows you to delete the logfile.
+
....
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 3;
RMAN-00571: ===========================================================
RMAN-00569: =============== ERROR MESSAGE STACK FOLLOWS ===============

RMAN> alter system switch logfile;

RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 3;

....

. Review the environment to make sure that all location-based parameters are updated.
+
....
SQL> select name from v$datafile;
SQL> select member from v$logfile;
SQL> select name from v$tempfile;
SQL> show parameter spfile;
SQL> select name, value from v$parameter where value is not null;

. The following script demonstrates how to simplify this process:
+
....

....

. If the ASM disk groups were completely evacuated, they can now be unmounted with `asmcmd`. However, in many cases the files belonging to other databases or the ASM spfile/passwd file might still be present.
+
....
-bash-4.1$ . oraenv
ORACLE_SID = [TOAST] ? +ASM
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /orabin
-bash-4.1$ asmcmd

== Oracle ASM to file system copy
The Oracle ASM to file system copy procedure is very similar to the ASM to ASM copy procedure, with similar benefits and restrictions. The primary difference is the syntax of the various commands and configuration parameters when using a visible file system as opposed to an ASM disk group.

=== Copy database
Oracle RMAN is used to create a level 0 (complete) copy of the source database currently located on the ASM disk group `+DATA` to the new location on `/oradata`.

....

....

=== Force archive log switch
Forcing the archive log switch is required to make sure that the archive logs contain all of the data required to make the copy fully consistent. Without this command, key data might still be present in the redo logs. To force an archive log switch, run the following command:

....
RMAN> sql 'alter system archive log current';
sql statement: alter system archive log current
....

=== Shut down source database
Disruption begins in this step because the database is shut down and placed in a limited-access read-only mode. To shut down the source database, run the following commands:

....
RMAN> shutdown immediate;
using target database control file instead of recovery catalog
database closed
database dismounted
Oracle instance shut down
RMAN> startup mount;
connected to target database (not started)
Oracle instance started
database mounted

Redo Buffers                5455872 bytes
....

=== Controlfile backup
Back up controlfiles in case you must abort the migration and revert to the original storage location. A copy of the backup controlfile isn't 100% required, but it does make the process of resetting the database file locations back to the original location easier.

....
RMAN> backup as copy current controlfile format '/tmp/TOAST.ctrl';

....

=== Parameter updates
....
RMAN> create pfile='/tmp/pfile' from spfile;
Statement processed
....

==== Update pfile
Any parameters referring to old ASM disk groups should be updated and, in some cases, deleted when they are no longer relevant. Update them to reflect the new file system paths and save the updated pfile. Make sure that the complete target path is listed. To update these parameters, run the following commands:

....
*.audit_file_dest='/orabin/admin/TOAST/adump'
*.audit_trail='db'
*.compatible='12.1.0.2.0'
*.control_files='/logs/TOAST/arch/control01.ctl','/logs/TOAST/redo/control02.ctl'
*.db_block_size=8192
*.db_domain=''
*.db_name='TOAST'
*.diagnostic_dest='/orabin'

*.pga_aggregate_target=256m
*.processes=300
*.remote_login_passwordfile='EXCLUSIVE'
*.sga_target=768m
*.undo_tablespace='UNDOTBS1'
....

==== Disable the original init.ora file
This file is located in the `$ORACLE_HOME/dbs` directory and is usually in a pfile that serves as a pointer to the spfile on the ASM disk group. To make sure that the original spfile is no longer used, rename it. Do not delete it, however, because this file is needed if the migration must be aborted.

....
[oracle@jfsc1 ~]$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
[oracle@jfsc1 dbs]$ cat initTOAST.ora
SPFILE='+ASM0/TOAST/spfileTOAST.ora'
[oracle@jfsc1 dbs]$ mv initTOAST.ora initTOAST.ora.prev
[oracle@jfsc1 dbs]$
....

==== Parameter file recreation
This is the final step in spfile relocation. The original spfile is no longer used and the database is currently started (but not mounted) using the intermediate file. The contents of this file can be written out to the new spfile location as follows:

....
RMAN> create spfile from pfile='/tmp/pfile';
Statement processed
....

==== Start database to start using new spfile
You must start the database to release the locks on the intermediate file and start the database by using only the new spfile file. Starting the database also proves that the new spfile location is correct and its data is valid.

....
RMAN> shutdown immediate;
Oracle instance shut down
RMAN> startup nomount;
connected to target database (not started)
Oracle instance started

Redo Buffers                   5455872 bytes
....

=== Restore controlfile
A backup controlfile was created at the path `/tmp/TOAST.ctrl` earlier in the procedure. The new spfile defines the controlfile locations as /`logfs/TOAST/ctrl/ctrlfile1.ctrl` and `/logfs/TOAST/redo/ctrlfile2.ctrl`. However, those files do not yet exist.

. This command restores the controlfile data to the paths defined in the spfile.
+
....
RMAN> restore controlfile from '/tmp/TOAST.ctrl';
Starting restore at 13-MAY-16
using channel ORA_DISK_1
channel ORA_DISK_1: copied control file copy
output file name=/logs/TOAST/arch/control01.ctl
output file name=/logs/TOAST/redo/control02.ctl
Finished restore at 13-MAY-16
....

. Issue the mount command so that the controlfiles are discovered correctly and contain valid data.
+
....
RMAN> alter database mount;
Statement processed
released channel: ORA_DISK_1
....
+
To validate the `control_files` parameter, run the following command:
+
....
SQL> show parameter control_files;

                                                 tl
....

=== Log replay
The database is currently using the data files in the old location. Before the copy can be used, the data files must be synchronized. Time has passed during the initial copy process, and changes were logged primarily in the archive logs. These changes are replicated in the following two steps.

. Perform an RMAN incremental backup, which contains the archive logs.

. To change the active data files, run the `switch database to copy` command:
+
....
RMAN> switch database to copy;
datafile 1 switched to datafile copy "/oradata/TOAST/data_D-TOAST_I-2098173325_TS-SYSTEM_FNO-1_01r5fhjg"
datafile 2 switched to datafile copy "/oradata/TOAST/data_D-TOAST_I-2098173325_TS-SYSAUX_FNO-2_02r5fhjo"
datafile 3 switched to datafile copy "/oradata/TOAST/data_D-TOAST_I-2098173325_TS-UNDOTBS1_FNO-3_03r5fhjt"
datafile 4 switched to datafile copy "/oradata/TOAST/data_D-TOAST_I-2098173325_TS-USERS_FNO-4_05r5fhk6"
....

. Although the data files should be fully consistent, one final step is required to replay the remaining changes recorded in the online redo logs. Use the `recover database` command to replay these changes and make the copy 100% identical to the original. The copy is not yet open, however.
+
....
RMAN> recover database;
Starting recover at 13-MAY-16
using channel ORA_DISK_1
starting media recovery
archived log for thread 1 with sequence 28 is already on disk as file +ASM0/TOAST/redo01.log
archived log file name=+ASM0/TOAST/redo01.log thread=1 sequence=28
media recovery complete, elapsed time: 00:00:00
Finished recover at 13-MAY-16
....

==== Relocate Temporary Data Files
. Identify the location of temporary data files still in use on the original disk group.
+
....
RMAN> select file#||' '||name from v$tempfile;
FILE#||''||NAME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 +ASM0/TOAST/temp01.dbf
....

. To relocate the data files, run the following commands. If there are many tempfiles, use a text editor to create the RMAN command and then cut and paste it.
+
....
RMAN> run {
2> set newname for tempfile 1 to '/oradata/TOAST/temp01.dbf';
3> switch tempfile all;
4> }
executing command: SET NEWNAME
renamed tempfile 1 to /oradata/TOAST/temp01.dbf in control file
....

=== Redo log migration
The migration process is nearly complete, but the redo logs are still located on the original ASM disk group. Redo logs cannot be directly relocated. Instead, a new set of redo logs is created and added to the configuration, following by a drop of the old logs.

. Identify the number of redo log groups and their respective group numbers.
+
....
RMAN> select group#||' '||member from v$logfile;
GROUP#||''||MEMBER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 +ASM0/TOAST/redo01.log
2 +ASM0/TOAST/redo02.log
3 +ASM0/TOAST/redo03.log
....

. Enter the size of the redo logs.
+
....
RMAN> select group#||' '||bytes from v$log;
GROUP#||''||BYTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 52428800
2 52428800
3 52428800
....

. For each redo log, create a new group by using the same size as the current redo log group using the new file system location.
+
....
RMAN> alter database add logfile '/logs/TOAST/redo/log00.rdo' size 52428800;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database add logfile '/logs/TOAST/redo/log01.rdo' size 52428800;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database add logfile '/logs/TOAST/redo/log02.rdo' size 52428800;
Statement processed
....

. Remove the old logfile groups that are still located on the prior storage.
+
....
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 4;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 5;
Statement processed
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 6;
Statement processed
....

. If an error is encountered that blocks dropping an active log, force a switch to the next log to release the lock and force a global checkpoint. An example is shown below. The attempt to drop logfile group 3, which was located on the old location, was denied because there was still active data in this logfile. A log archiving followed by a checkpoint enables logfile deletion.
+
....
RMAN> alter database drop logfile group 4;
RMAN-00571: ===========================================================
RMAN-00569: =============== ERROR MESSAGE STACK FOLLOWS ===============
RMAN-00571: ===========================================================

RMAN> alter system switch logfile;

....

. Review the environment to make sure that all location-based parameters are updated.
+
....
SQL> select name from v$datafile;
SQL> select member from v$logfile;
SQL> select name from v$tempfile;
SQL> show parameter spfile;
SQL> select name, value from v$parameter where value is not null;

. The following script demonstrates how to make this process easier.

. If the ASM disk groups were completely evacuated, they can now be unmounted with `asmcmd`. In many cases, files belonging to other databases or the ASM spfile/passwd file can still be present.
+
....

=== Data file cleanup procedure
The migration process might result in data files with long or cryptic syntax, depending on how Oracle RMAN was used. In the example shown here, the backup was performed with the file format of `/oradata/TOAST/%U`. `%U` indicates that RMAN should create a default unique name for each data file. The result is similar to what is shown in the following text. The traditional names for the data files are embedded within the names. This can be cleaned up by using the scripted approach shown in link:sample-scripts.html#asm-migration-cleanup[ASM Migration Cleanup].

....

== Oracle ASM rebalance
As discussed previously, an Oracle ASM disk group can be transparently migrated to a new storage system by using the rebalancing process. In summary, the rebalancing process requires the addition of equal-sized LUNs to the existing group of LUNs followed by a drop operation of the prior LUN. Oracle ASM automatically relocates the underlying data to new storage in an optimal layout and then releases the old LUNs when complete.

The migration process uses efficient sequential I/O and does not generally cause any performance disruption, but the migration rate can be throttled when needed.

=== Identify data to be migrated
....
SQL> select name||' '||group_number||' '||total_mb||' '||path||' '||header_status from v$asm_disk;
NEWDATA_0003 1 10240 /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315864 MEMBER

SQL> select group_number||' '||name from v$asm_diskgroup;
1 NEWDATA
....

=== Create new LUNs
Create new LUNs of the same size, and set user and group membership as required. The LUNs should appear as `CANDIDATE` disks.

....

=== Add new LUNS
While the add and drop operations can be performed together, it is generally easier to add new LUNs in two steps. First, add the new LUNs to the disk group. This step results in half of the extents being migrated from the current ASM LUNs to the new LUNs.

The rebalance power indicates the rate at which data is being transferred. The higher the number, the higher the parallelism of the data transfer. The migration is performed with efficient sequential I/O operations that are unlikely to cause performance problems. However, if desired, the rebalance power of an ongoing migration can be adjusted with the `alter diskgroup [name] rebalance power [level]` command. Typical migrations use a value of 5.

....
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA add disk '/dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c31586b' rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA add disk '/dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315869' rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA add disk '/dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315858' rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA add disk '/dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c31586a' rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
....

=== Monitor operation
A rebalancing operation can be monitored and managed in multiple ways. We used the following command for this example.

....
SQL> select group_number,operation,state from v$asm_operation;
GROUP_NUMBER OPERA STAT
------------ ----- ----
           1 REBAL RUN
           1 REBAL WAIT
....

When migration is complete, no rebalancing operations are reported.

....
SQL> select group_number,operation,state from v$asm_operation;
no rows selected
....

=== Drop old LUNs
The migration is now halfway complete. It might be desirable to perform some basic performance tests to make sure that the environment is healthy. After confirmation, the remaining data can be relocated by dropping the old LUNs. Note that this does not result in immediate release of the LUNs. The drop operation signals Oracle ASM to relocate the extents first and then release the LUN.

....
sqlplus / as sysasm
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA drop disk NEWDATA_0000 rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup NEWDATA drop disk NEWDATA_0001 rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup newdata drop disk NEWDATA_0002 rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
SQL> alter diskgroup newdata drop disk NEWDATA_0003 rebalance power 5;
Diskgroup altered.
....

=== Monitor operation
The rebalancing operation can be monitored and managed in multiple ways. We used the following command for this example:

....
SQL> select group_number,operation,state from v$asm_operation;
GROUP_NUMBER OPERA STAT
------------ ----- ----
           1 REBAL RUN
           1 REBAL WAIT
....

When migration is complete, no rebalancing operations are reported.

....
SQL> select group_number,operation,state from v$asm_operation;
no rows selected
....

=== Remove old LUNs
Before you remove the old LUNs from the disk group, you should perform one final check on the header status. After a LUN is released from ASM, it no longer has a name listed and the header status is listed as `FORMER`. This indicates that these LUNs can safely be removed from the system.

....
SQL> select name||' '||group_number||' '||total_mb||' '||path||' '||header_status from v$asm_disk;
NAME||''||GROUP_NUMBER||''||TOTAL_MB||''||PATH||''||HEADER_STATUS

== LVM migration
The procedure presented here shows the principles of an LVM-based migration of a volume group called `datavg`. The examples are drawn from the Linux LVM, but the principles apply equally to AIX, HP-UX, and VxVM. The precise commands might vary.

. Identify the LUNs currently in the `datavg` volume group.
+
....
[root@host1 ~]# pvdisplay -C | grep datavg
  /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c31582f datavg lvm2 a--  10.00g 10.00g
  /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c31585a datavg lvm2 a--  10.00g 10.00g
  /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315859 datavg lvm2 a--  10.00g 10.00g
  /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c31586c datavg lvm2 a--  10.00g 10.00g
....

. Create new LUNs of the same or slightly larger physical size and define them as physical volumes.
+
....
[root@host1 ~]# pvcreate /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315864

  Physical volume "/dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315861" successfully created
....

. Add the new volumes to the volume group.
+
....
[root@host1 tmp]# vgextend datavg /dev/mapper/3600a098038303537762b47594c315864
  Volume group "datavg" successfully extended

  Volume group "datavg" successfully extended
....

. Issue the `pvmove` command to relocate the extents of each current LUN to the new LUN. The `- i [seconds]` argument monitors the progress of the operation.
