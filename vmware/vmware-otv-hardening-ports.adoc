Listed here are the required ports and protocols that enable communication between ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere server and other entities like managed storage systems, servers, and other components.

== Inbound and outbound ports required for OTV
Please note the table below which lists the inbound and outbound ports required for the proper functioning of ONTAP tools. It is important to ensure that only the ports mentioned in the table are open for connections from remote machines, while all other ports should be blocked for connections from remote machines. This will help ensure the security and safety of your system.

The following table describes the open port details.

== Controlling remote access to the Derby database

Administrators can access the derby database with the following commands. It can be accessed through the ONTAP tools local VM as well as a remote server with the following steps:

 java -classpath "/opt/netapp/vpserver/lib/*" org.apache.derby.tools.ij;
 connect 'jdbc:derby://<OTV-IP>:1527//opt/netapp/vpserver/vvoldb;user=<user>;password=<password>';
