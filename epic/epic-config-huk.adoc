This section describes host integration for various operating systems. Use the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) to validate all versions of software and firmware.

== NetApp Host Utility Kit

NetApp recommends installing the NetApp Host Utility Kit (Host Utilities) on the operating systems of hosts that are connected to and accessing NetApp storage systems. Native Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) can be used and is supported. The OS must be asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA)-capable for multipathing. Installing the Host Utilities configures the host bus adapter (HBA) settings for NetApp storage. For more information, see the Interoperability Matrix Tool.
