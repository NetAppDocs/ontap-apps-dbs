Epic runs on all-flash arrays where most of the cost is the disk. Therefore, storage efficiency is critical for cost savings.

NetApp inline storage efficiency achieves industry-leading savings on storage with no effects to performance, and we even offer a written efficiency guarantee with the all-flash arrays. 

When calculating storage efficiency, it is important to measure raw to usable to effective capacity.  

* Raw capacity. Before any RAID is applied, size of disk by number of disks.

* Usable capacity. After RAID is applied, how much usable storage is available.

* Effective capacity. How much storage is provisioned and presented to the host or client.

The figure below is a sample efficiency calculation of a typical Epic deployment including all workloads requiring 852TB of effective storage and with 5.2:1 efficiency delivering 1.32PB of total effective data. 

Note: Based on the number of disks, raw-to-usable capacity varies slightly.

Note: NetApp does not use NetApp Snapshot™ technology or thin provisioning to calculate efficiency in the guarantee program. Doing so would show unrealistic efficiencies of 30–100:1, which do not mean anything when sizing real-world storage capacity.
