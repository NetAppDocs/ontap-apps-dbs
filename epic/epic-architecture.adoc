Epic overview

This section describes the Epic software environment and the key components that require storage. It provides key considerations to help guide storage design.
Epic is a software company headquartered in Verona, Wisconsin. Epic makes software for midsize and large medical groups, hospitals, and integrated healthcare organizations. Customers also include community hospitals, academic facilities, children's organizations, safety net providers, and multi-hospital systems. Epic-integrated software spans clinical, access, and revenue functions and extends into the home.

It is beyond the scope of this document to cover the wide span of functions supported by Epic software. From the storage system point of view, however, all Epic software shares a single patient-centric database for each deployment. Epic is transitioning from InterSystems Caché database to the new InterSystems Iris database. Because the storage requirements are the same for Caché and Iris, we will refer to the database as Iris throughout the rest of this document. Iris is available for operating systems AIX and Linux.

The primary focus of this best practices guide is to show you how to set up a NetApp storage system to meet the performance-driven requirements for the Iris database used in an Epic software environment. Dedicated storage resources are generally provided for the production database, whereas mirror database instances share secondary storage resources with other Epic software-related components, such as the Clarity reporting tools. Other software storage environments, such as those used for application and system files, are also provided by the secondary storage resources.

The remainder of this section identifies the various database servers used in an Epic software environment and describes their storage workload requirements.

== InterSystems Iris

InterSystems Iris is the database used by the Epic application. In this database, the data server is the access point for persistently stored data. The application server manages database queries and makes data requests to the data server. For most Epic software environments, the use of the symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) architecture in a single database server suffices to service Epic applications’ database requests. In large deployments, a distributed model can be supported by using InterSystems’ Enterprise Caché Protocol (ECP).

The use of failover-enabled clustered hardware enables a standby data server to access the same storage as the primary data server. It also enables the standby data server to take over processing responsibilities during a hardware failure.

InterSystems also provides technologies to satisfy data replication, disaster recovery, and high-availability (HA) requirements. InterSystems’ replication technology is typically used to synchronously or asynchronously replicate an Iris database from a primary data server to one or more secondary data servers. NetApp SnapMirror® storage-based replication is commonly used for WebBLOB for backup and disaster recovery.

The updated Iris database brings a few advantages:

* Increased scale and enables larger organizations with multiple Epic instances to consolidate into one larger instance.

* A licensing holiday where customers can now move between AIX and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) without paying for a new platform license.

== Caché database servers and storage usage

* Production. In Epic software environments, a single patient-centric database is deployed. In Epic’s hardware requirements, the physical server hosting the primary read/write Iris data server is called the production database server. This server requires high performance all-flash storage for files belonging to the primary database instance. For high availability, Epic supports the use of a failover database server that has access to the same files. Iris uses Epic Mirror to replicate to read-only Report, disaster recovery and support read-only copies. Each type of database server can be switched to read/write mode for business continuity reasons.

* Report. A reporting mirror database server provides read-only access to production data. It hosts an Iris data server configured as a backup mirror of the production Iris data server. The reporting database server has the same storage capacity requirements as the production database server. Reporting write performance is the same as production but read workload characteristics are different and sized differently.

* Supports read-only. This database server is optional and not shown in Figure 1. A mirror database server can also be deployed to support Epic supports read-only functionality, in which access is provided to a copy of production in read-only mode. This type of database server can be switched to read/write mode for business continuity reasons.

* Disaster recovery. To meet business continuity and disaster recovery objectives, a disaster recovery mirror database server is commonly deployed at a site geographically separate from the production and/or reporting mirror database servers. A disaster recovery mirror database server also hosts an Iris data server configured as a backup mirror of the production Iris data server. If the production site becomes unavailable for an extended time, this backup mirror database server can be configured to act as a mirror read/write instance (SRW). The backup mirror database server has the same file storage requirements as the production database server. In contrast, the backup mirror database storage is sized the same as the production storage from a performance perspective for business continuity.

* Test. Healthcare organizations often deploy development, testing, and staging environments. Additional Iris data servers for these environments also require storage, which can be accommodated by the same storage system. Epic has specific requirements and constraints for providing additional storage from a shared storage system. These specific requirements are addressed generically by the best practices in this document.

In addition to Iris ODB data servers, Epic software environments commonly include other components such as the following and as shown in Figure 2:

* An Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server database server as a back end to Epic’s Clarity business-reporting tools

Note: Clarity is used to report on data extracted daily from the reporting Iris database.

* WebBLOB server (CIFS)

* Multipurpose database server

* Multipurpose virtual machines (VMs)

* Hyperspace for client access

The storage requirements of all these multiple workloads, pools, NAS and SAN protocols can be consolidated and hosted by a single NetApp ONTAP cluster. This consolidation enables healthcare organizations to have a single data management strategy for all Epic, and Non-Epic, workloads.

Operational database workloads

Each Epic database server performs I/O on the following types of files:

* Database files
* Journal files
* Application files

The workload of an individual database server depends on its role in the Epic software environment. For example, production database files typically incur the most demanding workload, consisting of 100% random I/O requests. The workloads of any mirror database are typically less demanding and have fewer read requests. Journal files workloads are mainly sequential.

Epic maintains a workload model for storage performance benchmarking and customer workload. For more information about the Epic workload model, benchmark results, and guidance on using NetApp sizing tools to correctly size storage for Epic environments, see TR-3930i: NetApp Sizing Guidelines for Epic (NetApp login required). 

Epic also provides each customer with a customized hardware configuration guide containing I/O projections and storage capacity requirements. The final storage requirements might include development, testing, and/or staging environments, and any other ancillary workloads that can be consolidated. The customer can use the hardware configuration guide to communicate the total storage requirements to NetApp. This guide contains all the data needed to size an Epic deployment.

During the deployment phase, Epic provides a Database Storage Layout Guide, which provides more granular LUN-level details that can be used for an advanced storage design. Note that the Database Storage Layout Guide is general storage recommendations and not specific to NetApp. Use this guide to determine the best storage layout on NetApp.
