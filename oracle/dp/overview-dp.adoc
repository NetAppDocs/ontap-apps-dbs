[.lead]
The most mission-critical data is found in databases. 

An enterprise cannot operate without access to its data, and sometimes, the data defines the business. This data must be protected; however, data protection is more than just ensuring a usable backupâ€”it is about performing the backups quickly and reliably in addition to storing them safely. The other side of data protection is data recovery. When data is inaccessible, the enterprise is affected and might be inoperative until data is restored. This process must be fast and reliable. Finally, most databases must be protected against disasters, which means maintaining a replica of the database. The replica must be sufficiently up to date. It must also be quick and simple to make the replica a fully operational database.

[NOTE]
This section is based on TR-4591: Oracle data protection: Backup, recovery, and replication.
