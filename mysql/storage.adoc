[.lead]
MySQL databases can be placed on NFS or SAN filesystems.

== NFS
[TIP]
*NetApp recommends* using NFSv4.1 if NFSv4 capabilities are required. There are some functional enhancements to the NFSv4 protocol in NFSv4.1 that improve resiliency in certain edge cases. 

Use the following mount option while mounting an NFS file system:
....
nfs4 rw, hard,nointr,bg,vers=4,sync,proto=tcp,noatime,rsize=65536,wsize=65536
....

=== NFS Transfer Sizes

By default, ONTAP limits NFS I/O sizes to 64K.
