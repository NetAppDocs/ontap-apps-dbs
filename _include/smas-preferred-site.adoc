SnapMirror active sync will consider one site the "source" and the other the "destination". This implies a one-way replication relationship, but this does not apply to IO. Replication is bidirectional and symmetric, as it IO response times.

The `source` designation is controls the preferred site. If the replication link is lost, the LUN paths on the source copy will continue to serve data while the LUN paths on the destination copy will become unavailable until replication is reestablished as enters a synchronous state. The paths will then resume serving data.

My current configuration has site A as the preferred site for both Oracle and ONTAP. This can be viewed via SystemManager:

or at the CLI:

                      Relationship Type: XDP

The key is that the source is the SVM on cluster1. As mentioned above, the terms "source" and "destination" don't describe the flow of replicated data. Both sites can process a write and replicate it to the opposite site. In effect, both clusters are sources and destinations. The effect of designating one cluster as a source simply controls which cluster survives as a read-write storage system if the replication link is lost.
