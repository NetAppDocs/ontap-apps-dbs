A storage connector is required only in multiple-host environments that have failover capabilities. In multiple-host setups, SAP HANA provides high-availability functionality so that an SAP HANA database host can fail over to a standby host. In this case, the LUNs of the failed host are accessed and used by the standby host. The storage connector is used to make sure that a storage partition can be actively accessed by only one database host at a time.

In SAP HANA multiple-host configurations with NetApp storage, the standard storage connector delivered by SAP is used. The “SAP HANA FC Storage Connector Admin Guide” can be found as an attachment to https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1900823[SAP note 1900823^].
