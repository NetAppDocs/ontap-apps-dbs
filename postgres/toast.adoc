= TOAST

TOAST stands for The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique. PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8KB) and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store large field values directly. When you attempt to store a row that exceeds this size, TOAST breaks up the data of large columns into smaller “pieces” and stores them in a TOAST table.

The large values of toasted attributes are pulled out (if selected at all) only at the time the result set is sent to the client. The table itself is much smaller and can fit more rows into the shared buffer cache than it could without any out-of-line storage (TOAST).
