Although LUN resizing is an option to increase capacity, it is generally better to use an LVM, including Oracle ASM. One of the principal reasons LVMs exist is to avoid the need for a LUN resize. With an LVM, multiple LUNs are bonded together into a virtual pool of storage. The logical volumes carved out of this pool are managed by the LVM and can be easily resized. An additional benefit is the avoidance of hotspots on a particular drive by distributing a given logical volume across all available LUNs. Transparent migration can usually be performed by using the volume manager to relocate the underlying extents of a logical volume to new LUNs.
