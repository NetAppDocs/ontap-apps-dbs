== Efficiency best practices
NetApp recommends the following:

=== AFF defaults
Volumes created on ONTAP running on an all-flash AFF system are thin provisioned with all inline efficiency features enabled. Although databases generally do not benefit from deduplication and may include uncompressible data, the default settings are nevertheless appropriate for almost all workloads. ONTAP is designed to efficiently process all types of data and I/O patterns, whether or not they result in savings. Defaults should only be changed if the reasons are fully understood and there is a benefit to deviating.

=== General recommendations
* If volumes and/or LUNs are not thin provisioned, you should must disable all efficiency settings because using these features provides no savings and the combination of thick provisioning with space efficiency enabled can cause unexpected behavior, including out-of-space errors.
* If data is not subject to overwrites, such as with backups or database transaction logs, you can achieve greater efficiency by enabling TSSE with a low cooling period. 
* Some files might contain a significant amount of uncompressible data, for example when compression is already enabled at the application level of files are encrypted. If any of these scenarios are true, consider disabling compression to allow more efficient operation on other volumes containing compressible data.
* Do not use both 32KB compression and deduplication with database backups. See the section ""<<Adaptive compression>>"" for details.
