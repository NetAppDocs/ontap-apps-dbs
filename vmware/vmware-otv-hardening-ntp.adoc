Sometimes, security issues can occur due to discrepancies in network time configurations. It is important to ensure that all devices within a network have accurate time settings to prevent such issues.

== *Virtual appliance*

You can configure the NTP server(s) from the maintenance console in the virtual appliance.  Users can add the NTP server details under _System Configuration_ => _Add new NTP Server_ option

By default, the service for NTP is ntpd. This is a legacy service and does not work well for virtual machines in certain cases.

== *Debian* 

On Debian, the user can access the /etc/ntp.conf file for ntp server details.
