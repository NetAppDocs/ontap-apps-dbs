Combining NAS and SAN on the same all-flash array is supported. 

NetApp recommends using FlexGroup volumes for NAS shares, such as WebBLOB (when available).

WebBLOB is up to 95% cold data. You can optionally free space on your all-flash array and tier backups and cold data to object storage on-premises or in the cloud using the FabricPool feature. All of which can be accomplished without any noticeable performance effect. FabricPool is part of ONTAP, so you can generate a cold data report to review how cold your data is before enabling automatic tiering. You can set the age of the data to tier through policy. Epic customers have realized significant savings with this feature.
