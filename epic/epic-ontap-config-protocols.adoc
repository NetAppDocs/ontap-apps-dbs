FCP is the preferred protocol for presenting LUNs. NetApp recommends single initiator zoning: one initiator per zone with all the required target ports on storage using worldwide port names (WWPNs).

After the LUN is created, map the LUN to the initiator group (igroup) containing the WWPNs of the host to enable access.
