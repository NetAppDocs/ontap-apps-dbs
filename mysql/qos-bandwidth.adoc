= Bandwidth QoS

Not all I/O sizes are the same. Databases might perform a large number of fully random block reads, which would result in the IOPS threshold being reached. But databases might also perform a full table scan operation, which would consist of few large block reads, consuming a lot of bandwidth, but relatively few IOPS.
