= SAN leadership

There is no better example of NetApp SAN leadership than the NVA Epic on Modern SAN released April 2021. This document guides you through implementing Epic on a modern Gen7 SAN using NVMe/FC for any size Epic environment. NetApp is a founding member of NVMeexpress.org and the first storage vendor with NVMe/FC. The NVA details an NVMe/FC deployment of Epic and compares results with FCP.
