SAP HANA hosts are connected to storage controllers using a redundant FCP infrastructure and multipath software. A redundant FCP switch infrastructure is required to provide fault-tolerant SAP HANA host-to-storage connectivity in case of switch or host-bus-adapter (HBA) failure. Appropriate zoning must be configured at the switch to allow all HANA hosts to reach the required LUNs on the storage controllers.

Different models of the AFF system product family can be mixed and matched at the storage layer to allow for growth and differing performance and capacity needs. The maximum number of SAP HANA hosts that can be attached to the storage system is defined by the SAP HANA performance requirements and the model of NetApp controller used. The number of required disk shelves is only determined by the capacity and performance requirements of the SAP HANA systems.

The following figure shows an example configuration with eight SAP HANA hosts attached to a storage HA pair.

This architecture can be scaled in two dimensions:

* By attaching additional SAP HANA hosts and storage capacity to the existing storage, if the storage controllers provide enough performance to meet the current SAP HANA KPIs
* By adding more storage systems with additional storage capacity for the additional SAP HANA hosts

The following figure shows a configuration example in which more SAP HANA hosts are attached to the storage controllers. In this example, more disk shelves are necessary to meet the capacity and performance requirements of the 16 SAP HANA hosts. Depending on the total throughput requirements, you must add additional FC connections to the storage controllers.

Independently of the deployed AFF system, the SAP HANA landscape can also be scaled by adding any certified storage controllers to meet the desired node density, as shown in the following figure.
