= Deduplication

Data deduplication cuts storage requirements by reducing redundancies in primary, backup, and archival data. Inline deduplication of zeros speeds up database performance by 20% to 30%. Further improvements to inline deduplication in ONTAP 9 provide additional efficiency by extending elimination of duplicate data to blocks in memory and SSDs.
