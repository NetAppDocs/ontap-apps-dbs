summary: ONTAP supports all major storage protocols used for virtualization, such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), or Non-Volatile Memory Express over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) for SAN environments, as well as NFS (v3 and v4.1), and SMB or S3 for guest connections. Customers are free to pick what works best for their environment and can combine protocols as needed on a single system.

[.lead]
NetApp provides several standalone software tools compatible with both traditional ONTAP and ASA systems, integrating vSphere to effectively manage your virtualized environment.

The following tools are included with the ONTAP One license at no additional cost. See Figure 1 for a depiction of how these tools work together in your vSphere environment.

== ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv10/docs-tab[ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere] is a set of tools for using ONTAP storage together with vSphere. The vCenter plug-in, formerly known as the Virtual Storage Console (VSC), simplifies storage management and efficiency features, enhances availability, and reduces storage costs and operational overhead, whether you are using SAN or NAS. It uses best practices for provisioning datastores and optimizes ESXi host settings for NFS and block storage environments. For all these benefits, NetApp recommends using these ONTAP tools as a best practice when using vSphere with systems running ONTAP. It includes a server appliance, UI extensions for vCenter, VASA Provider, and Storage Replication Adapter. Nearly everything in ONTAP tools can be automated by using simple REST APIs, consumable by most modern automation tools.

* *vCenter UI extensions.* The ONTAP tools UI extensions simplify the job of operations teams and vCenter admins by embedding easy-to-use, context-sensitive menus for managing hosts and storage, informational portlets, and native alerting capabilities directly in the vCenter UI for streamlined workflows.

* *VASA Provider for ONTAP.* The VASA Provider for ONTAP supports the VMware vStorage APIs for Storage Awareness (VASA) framework. It is supplied as part of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a single virtual appliance for ease of deployment. VASA Provider connects vCenter Server with ONTAP to aid in provisioning and monitoring VM storage. It enables VMware Virtual Volumes (vVols) support, management of storage capability profiles and individual VM vVols performance, and alarms for monitoring capacity and compliance with the profiles.

* *Storage Replication Adapter.* The SRA is used together with VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR)/Site Recovery Manager (SRM) to manage data replication between production and disaster recovery sites using SnapMirror for array-based-replication. It can automate the task of failover in the event of disaster, and can help test the DR replicas nondisruptively to ensure confidence in your DR solution.

The following figure depicts ONTAP tools for vSphere.

== SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere
The https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/scv/docs-tab[SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere] is a plug-in for vCenter Server that enables you to manage backups and restores of virtual machines (VMs) and datastores. It provides a single interface for managing backups, restores, and clones of VMs and datastores across multiple ONTAP systems. SnapCenter supports replication to and recovery from secondary sites using SnapMirror. The latest versions also support SnapMirror to cloud (S3), Tamperproof snapshots, SnapLock, and SnapMirror active sync. The SnapCenter Plug-In for VMware vSphere can be integrated with SnapCenter application plugins to provide application consistent backups. 

== NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI
The https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/nfsplugin-vmware-vaai/about-tab[NetApp NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI] is a plug-in for ESXi hosts that allows them to use VAAI features with NFS datastores on ONTAP. It supports copy offload for clone operations, space reservation for thick virtual disk files, and snapshot offload. Offloading copy operations to storage is not necessarily faster to complete, but it does reduce network bandwidth requirements and offloads host resources such as CPU cycles, buffers, and queues. You can use ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to install the plug-in on ESXi hosts or, where supported, vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM).

== Premium software options
The following premium software products are available from NetApp. They are not included with the ONTAP One license and must be purchased separately.
* https://www.netapp.com/data-services/disaster-recovery/[BlueXP Disaster Recovery (DR)] for VMware vSphere. This is a cloud-based service that provides disaster recovery and backup for VMware environments. It can be used with or without SnapCenter and supports on-prem to on-prem DR using SAN or NAS, and on-prem to/from cloud using NFS where supported.
* https://www.netapp.com/data-infrastructure-insights/[Data Infrastructure Insights (DII)]. This is a cloud-based service that provides monitoring and analytics for VMware environments. It supports other storage vendors in a heterogenous storage environments, as well as multiple switch vendors and other hypervisors. DII provides complete end-to-end insights into performance, capacity, and health of your VMware environment.
