On a ONTAP system, storage is organized in 4KB units. A database or file system 8KB block should map to exactly two 4KB blocks. If an error in LUN configuration shifts the alignment by 1KB in either direction, each 8KB block would exist on three different 4KB storage blocks rather than two. This arrangement would cause increased latency and cause additional I/O to be performed within the storage system.

Alignment also affects LVM architectures. If a physical volume within a logical volume group is defined on the whole drive device (no partitions are created), the first 4KB block on the LUN aligns with the first 4KB block on the storage system. This is a correct alignment. Problems arise with partitions because they shift the starting location where the OS uses the LUN. As long as the offset is shifted in whole units of 4KB, the LUN is aligned.

In Linux environments, build logical volume groups on the whole drive device. When a partition is required, check alignment by running `fdisk â€“u` and verifying that the start of each partition is a multiple of eight. This means that the partition starts at a multiple of eight 512-byte sectors, which is 4KB.
