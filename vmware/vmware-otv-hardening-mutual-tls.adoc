[.lead]
ONTAP version 9.7 and above supports Mutual TLS communication and starting 9.12, ONTAP Tools for VMware and vSphere uses mutual TLS for communicating with ONTAP for any newly added cluster(Depending on ONTAP version).

== ONTAP
For all previously added storage system: During upgrade all added storage storage system will get auto trusted and certificate based authentication mechanism gets configured. 

As in the below screenshot, the Cluster setup page will show the status of Mutual TLS (Certificate based authentication), configured for each cluster.

=== *Cluster Add* 

During cluster add workflow, if the cluster being added supports MTLS, MTLS will be configured by default. User need not to do any configuration for this. Below screen shot shows the screen presented to user during cluster add.

=== Cluster Edit

During cluster edit operation, there are two scenarios:

* If the ONTAP certificate expires then user will have to get the new cert and upload it.
* If the OTV certificate expires then user can regenerate it by checking the checkbox.
** _Generate a new client certificate for ONTAP._
