= Filesystems

[.lead]
PostgreSQL can be hosted on either NFS or SAN filesystems

== NFS

With NFS, NetApp recommends using version 4.1, because it has an integrated locking feature that version 3 lacks. Also, it has new features such as statefulness, improved security, and strong authentication. 

Use the following mount option while mounting an NFS file system:
....
nfs4 rw, hard,nointr,bg,vers=4,sync,proto=tcp,noatime,rsize=65536,wsize=65536
....

For higher performance options, see link:/common/storage-configuration/nfs.html#ontap-nfs-transfer-sizes[NFS Transfer Sizes]

== SAN

For guidance on SAN configuration and important details about LVM striping and LUN counts, see link:/common/storage-configuration/fcsan.html[FC SAN]
