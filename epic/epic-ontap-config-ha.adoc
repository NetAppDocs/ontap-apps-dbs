= Storage node configuration

High availability

Storage systems configured with nodes in a high availability (HA) pair mitigate the effect of node failure and enable nondisruptive upgrades of the storage system. There is no single point of failure.

Each node in the HA pair is active-active writing to disk to maximize overall utilization. Disk shelves connected to nodes with multiple paths increase storage resiliency by protecting against a single-path failure while providing improved performance consistency during a node failover.
