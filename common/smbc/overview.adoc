SM-BC was introduced in the ONTAP 9.8 release for customer preview and was made generally available for production use in the ONTAP 9.9.1 release. SM-BC and SM-S share a replication engine, however, SM-BC includes additional features such as transparent application failover and failback for enterprise applications.
