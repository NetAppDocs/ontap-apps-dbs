== Epic on ONTAP

This section covers a long list of considerations for an Epic solution. I am sure every storage vendor makes the same claims, making the platform decision even more complex. This section helps clarify each of these areas regarding NetApp. When examined all together, ONTAP is the clear choice for any healthcare data management system.

Epic is easier with ONTAP

This consideration is first because it is the most important when selecting a data management platform.

ONTAP is a single data management platform you can consolidate Epic workloads with while meeting all of your requirements.

This is a bold statement, and it is transformative to your organization. Why? Only on NetApp can you standardize all your healthcare workloads for SAN, NAS, and Object on a single high data management platform. ONTAP is the most widely deployed storage software in the world and comes with almost 30 years of constant innovation. You can meet all Epic challenges with native ONTAP data management tools and application integration. There is no need to purchase a multitude of third-party tools to fill gaps in the solution.

A lot of storage vendors offer traditional, reliable, and fast block storage. They work well but are typically deployed in silos to run a single workload like production, report, clarity, VDI, VMWare, and NAS. Each of these silos have different hardware and different management tools, and they are typically managed by different IT groups. This traditional approach adds to the biggest problem with healthcare today.

NetApp makes data management easier and more efficient. Instead of throwing money at the problem with oversized silos, ONTAP uses innovation and technology to enable a consistent and guaranteed SLA for each workload on a single platform over any protocol. These capabilities and tools extend out to the cloud of your choice as illustrated in Figure 3.

= Performance

NetApp is a clear leader in the storage industry as seen in the published performance results in the NVA Epic on Modern SAN. NetApp also is the leader in independent testing by SPC.

Epic workloads are between 1K to 2K IOPS/TB; however, these are not extreme workloads. So why is performance an important consideration?

* Consolidation for medium and small customers

* Given the performance scale ONTAP can achieve, you can consolidate a lot more workloads onto less hardware:

* ONTAP guarantees a consistent floor performance level for each workload

* Software upgrades:

* Every upgrade of ONTAP has a proven history of not only adding features but also increased storage efficiency, increased performance headroom and lower latency; millage will vary but we have seen increases from 20–40% per upgrade

* Nondisruptive upgrades can extend the life of your storage investment from 3 years to 5 or 6 years

* Cost:

* All the above adds up to lower cost and higher efficiency

= Reliability

At the core of ONTAP are nondisruptive operations that enable you to avoid costly disruption to business operations. NetApp delivers over 99.999999% availability based on production data, which is called home through NetApp Active IQ. Each HA pair in the cluster has no single point of failure. ONTAP dates back to 1992 and is the most widely deployed data management software in the world with an exceptional history of delivering reliable storage. Now, with Active IQ proactively monitoring and automatically resolving 97% of issues, availability is higher with significantly less support cases.

Epic recommends the use of HA storage systems to mitigate hardware component failure. This recommendation extends from basic hardware (such as redundant power supplies) to networking (such as multipath networking).

NetApp has a 100% written availability guarantee. Rest assured when you need to upgrade storage, scale up, scale out, or rebalance workloads across the cluster, there is no effect to patient care. You might move data, but you never again need to disrupt patient care with data migrations or forklift upgrades. Move to next-generation technology, futureproof, and avoid hardware lock-in.

= Scale

The Hardware Configuration Guide accounts for ~20% growth per year and it is sized to accommodate 3 years of growth. However, environments grow frequently and unexpectedly. NetApp can seamlessly scale performance and capacity up to 12 nodes for NAS, SAN, and Object clusters. As a result, you can nondisruptively scale up and out as your business grows.

Epic Iris brings added scale capabilities. It enables larger customers that have multiple Epic instances to consolidate to a single instance. The recent NetApp Verified Architecture Epic on Modern SAN demonstrates that Epic can seamlessly scale consolidated workloads to 720K IOPS on an single HA and scale out to over 4M IOPS in a cluster.

You can scale up nondisruptively by upgrading controllers or adding disks. You can scale out nondisruptively by adding HA pairs to the cluster. NAS, SAN, and Object data also has the ability to be moved nondisruptively between nodes in the cluster. Each HA pair in the cluster can be any combination of ONTAP FAS and AFF system types and sizes. You can balance your workloads across a single cluster to maximize your storage investment.

Epic runs better with the NetApp product portfolio, leveraging the data fabric with ONTAP, StorageGrid®, and the cloud of your choice. These products provide options for disaster recovery, archiving, analytics, tiering, and more.

ONTAP provides the option to use object storage on StorageGrid or the cloud as a backup target and/or automatic cold storage tiering target. This capability enables you to free up expensive, all-flash disks, tier snapshots, and cold data automatically to Object.

= Security

Security is the number one concern for organizations and healthcare executives today. It has never been more difficult to manage, and organizations are challenged with compliance, data governance, antivirus protection, and ransomware.

Security is beyond the scope of this document; however, TR-4569: Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 details all the extensive and advanced security features available with ONTAP software. 

Note: NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager) monitors for security violations based on the information included in TR-4569 and reports them in the dashboard to simplify managing security. These tools can help your organization meet your security goals to protect, detect, and remediate against attacks.

NetApp has partnered with security vendors to provide integration through NetApp FPolicy software to enhance your security offering.

NetApp ONTAP native Snapshot and immutable SnapLock® backup technologies offer a unique air gap capability to protect your patient records against ransomware. See a NetApp documentation on TR-4572: The NetApp Solution for Ransomware. For a more strategic approach to security, see TR-4829: NetApp and Zero Trust.

= Consolidation and Efficiency

One of the major challenges in healthcare is the inefficiency of siloed environments. Multiple point solutions are created by various groups that impedes progress. Having a unified strategy to data management brings efficiency to accelerate transformation. Disruptive technology like digitizing patient records, Ransomware, and generative AI all the drive the need for consolidation.

With ONTAP you can consolidate file/block/object and each of your tier 0/1/2/3 workloads on premises and in the cloud today.

== Efficiency

Epic runs on all-flash arrays where most of the cost is the disk. Therefore, storage efficiency is critical for cost savings. NetApp offers a written efficiency guarantee with the all-flash arrays. When calculating storage efficiency, it is important to measure raw to usable to effective capacity. Figure 4 illustrates how NetApp inline storage efficiency achieves industry-leading savings on storage with no effects to performance:

* Raw capacity. Before any RAID is applied, size of disk by number of disks.

* Usable capacity. After RAID is applied, how much usable storage is available.

* Effective capacity. How much storage is provisioned and presented to the host or client.

Figure 4 is a sample efficiency calculation of a typical Epic deployment including all workloads requiring 852TB of effective storage and with 5.2:1 efficiency delivering 1.32PB of total effective data. 

Note: Based on the number of disks, raw-to-usable capacity varies slightly.

Note: NetApp does not use NetApp Snapshot™ technology or thin provisioning to calculate efficiencies. Doing so would show unrealistic efficiencies of 30–100:1, which do not mean anything when sizing storage capacity.
