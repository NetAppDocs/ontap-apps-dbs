== Efficiency and thin provisioning
Efficiency features are forms of thin provisioning. For example, a 100GB LUN occupying a 100GB volume might compress down to 50GB. There are no actual savings realized yet because the volume is still 100GB. The volume must first be reduced in size so that the space saved can be used elsewhere on the system. If later changes to the 100GB LUN result in the data becoming less compressible, then the LUN grows in size and the volume could fill up.

Thin provisioning is strongly recommended because it can simplify management while delivering a substantial improvement in usable capacity with associated cost savings. The reason is simple - Oracle environments frequently include a lot of empty space, a large number of volumes and LUNs, and compressible data. Thick provisioning results in the reservation of space on storage for volumes and LUNs just in case they someday become 100% full and contain 100% uncompressible data. That is unlikely to ever occur. Thin provisioning allows that space to be reclaimed and used elsewhere and allows capacity management to be based on the storage system itself rather than many smaller volumes and LUNs.

Some customers prefer to use thick provisioning, either for specific workloads or generally based on established operational and procurement practices.

*Caution:* If a volume is thick provisioned, care must be taken to completely disable all efficiency features for that volume, including decompression and the removal of deduplication using the `sis undo` command. The volume should not appear in `volume efficiency show` output. If it does, the volume is still partially configured for efficiency features. As a result, overwrite guarantees work differently, which increases the chance that configuration oversights cause the volume to unexpectedly run out of space, resulting in database I/O errors.
