summary: SnapCenter allows you to create backup policies that can be applied to multiple jobs. These policies can define schedule, retention, replication, and other capabilities. They continue to allow optional selection of VM-consistent snapshots, which leverages the hypervisor's ability to quiesce I/O before taking a VMware snapshot.

[.lead]
VMware Storage Distributed Resource Scheduler (SDRS) is a vSphere feature that places VMs on storage based on the current I/O latency and space usage. 

It then moves the VM or VMDKs nondisruptively between the datastores in a datastore cluster (also referred to as a pod), selecting the best datastore in which to place the VM or VMDKs in the datastore cluster. A datastore cluster is a collection of similar datastores that are aggregated into a single unit of consumption from the vSphere administrator's perspective.

When using SDRS with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you must first create a datastore with the plug-in, use vCenter to create the datastore cluster, and then add the datastore to it. After the datastore cluster is created, additional datastores can be added to the datastore cluster directly from the provisioning wizard on the Details page.

Other ONTAP best practices for SDRS include the following:

* All datastores in the cluster should use the same type of storage (such as SAS, SATA, or SSD), be either all VMFS or NFS datastores, and have the same replication and protection settings.
* Consider using SDRS in default (manual) mode. This approach allows you to review the recommendations and decide whether to apply them or not. Be aware of these effects of VMDK migrations:
** When SDRS moves VMDKs between datastores, any space savings from ONTAP cloning or deduplication are lost. You can rerun deduplication to regain these savings.
** After SDRS moves VMDKs, NetApp recommends recreating the snapshots at the source datastore because space is otherwise locked by the VM that was moved.
** Moving VMDKs between datastores on the same aggregate has little benefit, and SDRS does not have visibility into other workloads that might share the aggregate.
